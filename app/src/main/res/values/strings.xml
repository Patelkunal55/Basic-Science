<b>Plasma state:</b> Plasma state consists of super energetic and super excited particles. These particles are in the form of ionized gases. Plasma can occur when matter is heated to a very high temperature. The matter in plasma state is a collection of free highly energetic and highly excited electrically charged particles.<br/>
The florescent tube and neon sign bulbs contain inert gases . Plasma can occur when matter is heated to a very high temperature. The matter in plasma state is a collection of free highly energetic and highly excited electrically charged particles.<br/>

The fluorescent tubes and neon sign bulbs contain inert gases, when electric current is passed through them, they produce glowing plasma, having a characteristic is the presence of plasma that make CFL tube glow.<br/>
<b>Pure substances :</b> A single substance (or matter) which can not be separated into other kinds of matter by any physical process is called pure substance.
Pure substances have been classified as elements and compounds.<br/>

<b>Elements :</b> The simplest form of a pure substance which can neither be broken into nor built from simpler substances by ordinary physical and chemical methods is called element.
Elements are further classified into three types 1. Metals 2. Non-metals and 3. Metalloids.<br/>
<b>Metals :</b> Metals are solids (exception mercury which is liquid at room temperature) are normally hard. They have lustre, high melting point (mp) and boiling point (bp) and also good conductor of electricity and heat. The conductivity of metal decreases with increase in temperature due to vibration of positive ions at their Lattice points. Examples—Iron, Copper, Silver, Gold, Aluminium, Zinc etc. <br/>
<b>Non-metals :</b> Non-metals are the elements with properties opposite to those of the metals. They are found in all states of matter. They do not possess lustre (exception—iodine). They are poor conductors of electricity (exception-graphite) and they are not malleable and ductile. Examples—Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulphur, Phosphorous etc. <br/>
<b>Metalloids :</b> Metalloids are the elements which have common properties of both metals and non-metals. Examples—Arsenic, Antimony, Bismuth etc.

<b>Compounds :</b> Compounds are pure substances that are composed of two or more different elements in fixed proportion by mass. The properties of a compound are entirely different from those of the elements from which it is made. Example—Water, Sugar, Salt, chloroform, Alcohol, Ether etc. <br/>
Compounds are classified into two types— <br/>
<b>1.	Organic Compounds :</b> The Compounds obtained from living sources are called organic compounds. The term organic is now applied to hydrocarbons and their derivatives. Examples— Carbohydrates, Proteins, Oils, Fats etc. <br/>

<b>2.	Inorganic Compounds :</b> The Compounds obtained from non-living sources such as rocks and minerals are called inorganic compounds. Examples—Common Salt, Marble, Washing Soda etc. <br/>
<b>Mixtures :</b> A material obtained by mixing two or more substances in any indefinite proportion is called a mixture. The properties of the components in a mixture remain unchanged. Example— Milk, Sea water, Petrol, Paint, Glass, Cement, Wood etc. <br/>
There are two types of mixture— <br/>
1.	Homogeneous mixture and 2. Heterogeneous mixture. <br/>
<b>1. Homogeneous mixture :</b> A mixture is said to be homogeneous if it has a uniform composition through out and there are no visible boundaries of separation between constituents. More over, the constituents can not be seen even by a microscope. Examples—Common salt dissolved in water, sugar dissolved in water, iodine dissolved in CCI , benzene in toluene and methyl alcohol in water. <br/>

<b>2. Heterogeneous mixture :</b> A mixture is said to be heterogeneous if it does not have a uniform composition throughout and has visible boundaries of separation between the various constituents. The different constituents of the heterogeneous mixture can be seen even with naked eye. Example—A mixture of Sulphur & Sand, A mixture of Iron filings & Sand etc. <br/>
<b>Separation of mixture :</b> Some methods of separation of mixtures are given below— <br/>
<b>1.Sublimation :</b> Sublimation is a process of conversion of a solid into vapour without passing through the liquid state and This method can be used for the substances which are sublime in their separation from non-sublimate materials. Examples of sublimes are Naphthalene, Iodine, Ammonium Chloride, Camphor etc. <br/>
<b>2.	Filtration :</b> This is a process for quick and complete removal of suspended solid particles from a liquid, by passing the suspension through a filter paper. Examples—1. removed of solid particles from the engine oil in car engine. 2. filtration of tea from tea leaves in the preparation of tea etc. <br/>
<b>3.	Evaporation :</b> The process of conversion of a liquid into its vapours at room temperature is called evaporation. Evaporation causes cooling. Example—1. Evaporation of water in summer from Ponds, wells & lakes. 2. Preparation of common salt from sea water by evaporation of water. <br/>
<b>4.	Crystallization :</b> This method is mostly used for separation and purification of solid substances. In this process, the impure solid or mixture is heated with suitable solvent (e.g. alcohol, water, acetone, chloroform) to its boiling point and the hot solution is filtered. The clear filtrate is cooled slowly to room temperature, when pure solid crystallizes out. This is separated by filtration and dried. <br/>
For the separation of more complex mixtures, fractional crystallization is used, in which the components of the mixtures crystallize out at different interval of time. <br/>
 <b>5. Distillation :</b> It is a process of converting a liquid into its vapour by heating and then condensing the vapour again into the same liquid by cooling. Thus, distillation involves vaporisation and condensation both <br/>
<b>Distillation = Vaporisation + Condensation </b><br/>
This method is employed to separate the liquids which have different boiling points or a liquid from non-volatile solid or solids either in solution or suspension. Example—A mixture of copper sulphate and water or a mixture of water (B.P 1000C) and methyl alcohol (B.P 450C) can be separated by this method.<br/>

<b>6.	Fractional distillation :</b> This process is similar to the distillation process except that a fractionating column is used to separate two or more volatile liquid which have different boiling points. Example—I. Methyl alcohol (bp = 338 K) and acetone (bp = 329 K) can be separated by fractional distillation process. 2. Separation of petrol, diesel oil, kerosene oil, heavy oil etc from crude petroleum. 3. Separation of oxygen, nitrogen inert gasses and carbon dioxide from liquid air etc.<br/>
<b>7.	Chromatography :</b> The name chromatography is derived from Latin word Chroma meaning colour. The technique of chromatography is based on the difference in the rates at which the components of a mixture are absorbed in the suitable absorbent. <br/>
There are many types of chromatography. <br/>
a.	Column (absorption) Chromatography <br/>
b.	Thin layer chromatography <br/>
c.	Paper - chromatography <br/>
d.	High pressure liquid chromatography <br/>
e.	Ion-exchange chromatography <br/>
f.	Gas chromatography  <br/>

<b>Sedimentation and Decantation :</b> This method is used when one component is a liquid and other is an insoluble. Insoluble solid, heavier than liquid. i.e, mud and water. <br/>
If muddy water is allowed to stand undisturbed for sometime in a beaker the particles of earth (clay and sand) settle at the bottom. This process is called sedimentation. The clear liquid at the top can be gently transferred into another beaker. This process is known as decantation. <br/>
<b>Concept of change in state :</b> (a) Melting Point : The constant temperature at which a solid becomes liquid upon absorbing heat under normal pressure is called melting point of that solid m.p. of ice is OOC and m.p. of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is 8000C. <br/>

The melting point of a substance is a fixed temperature. Butifthere are impurities in a substance, the melting point of that substance can change considerably. for example the m.p of mixture of ice and salt i.e. freezing mixture is —150C. <br/>
<b>b.	Boiling point :</b> The constant temperature at which a liquid changes to vapour state under normal atmospheric pressure is called boiling point. <br/>

    </string>
    <string name="che5">
<![CDATA[
The boiling point decreases with decrease in atmospheric pressure. Soluble impurities increases the boiling point of liquid. <br/>

<b>c.	Freezing Point :</b> The constant temperature at which a liquid changes into a solid by giving out heat energy is called freezing point of that liquid. F.P of water <br/>
= ooc. <br/>
<b>d.	Evaporation :</b> The process of conversion of a liquid into its vapours at room temperature is called evaporation. Evaporation causes cooling. Actually, during evaporation, the molecules having higher kinetic energy escape from the surface of the liquid. Therefore, average kinetic energy of the rest of the molecules decreases. Therefore cooling takes place during evaporation because of temperature of liquid is directly proportional to average kinetic Energy. Evaporation is affected by following factors, <br/>
1. Nature of liquid 2. Temperature 3. Surface area. <br/>

<b>(e) Vapour pressure :</b> The pressure exerted by the vapours of liquid in equilibrium with liquid at a given temperature is called vapour pressure. Vapour pressure depends upon—I. its nature and 2. temperature. <br/>
Higher the vapour pressure of a particular liquid lesser will be the magnitude of intermolecular forces present in molecules. Vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase in temperature. <br/>

Father of periodic table—Mendeleev. <br/>
The arrangement of the known elements in certain groups in such a way so that the elements with similar properties are grouped together is known as classification of elements. <br/>
<b>Genesis of periodic classification :</b><br/>
<b>1.	Lavoisier</b> classified the elements into metals and non-metals.<br/>
<b>2.	Dobereinier Triads :</b> In 1829, Dobereiner, a German chemist arranged certain elements with similar properties in groups of three in such a way that the atomic mass of the middle element was nearly the same as the average atomic masses of the first and third elements. <br/>

But only few elements could be covered under triads. <br/>
<b>3.Newland law of octaves :</b> In 1866, John Newlands, An English Chemist proposed the law of octaves by stating that, When elements are arranged in order to increasing atomic masses, every eighth elemen thasproperties similar to the first, just like musical notes.<br/>
But this generalization was also rejected because it could not be extended to the elements with atomic mass more than 40. <br/>
<b>4.	Lother—Mayer atomic volume curve :</b> In 1869 Lother mayer plotted a graph betweeen atomic volume of the elements and their atomic mass and he pointed that the elements with similar properties occupy similar position in the curve. <br/>
<b>5.	Mendeleev periodic law :</b> The physical and chemical properties of the elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses. <br/>
Mendeleev arranged all the elements known at that time in increasing order of atomic mass and this arrangement become periodic table. <br/>
<b>In a periodic table :</b><br/>
Horizontal line is called periods and Vertical line is called group. <br/>
In Mendeleev periodic table : Total number of periods are seven and total number of groups are nine i.e., <br/>
Period— 7 <br/>
Group— 9 (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, zero) <br/>
<b>6.	Modern Periodic law :</b> Modern periodic law was given by Moseley. <br/>

 <b>Acidity of a base :</b> The number of removable hydroxyl (OH-) ions from a base is called acidity of a base. <br/>
Acidity of NaOH = 1 <br/>
Acidity of KOH = 1<br/>
Acidity of Ca(OH)2 = 2 <br/>
<b>The pH scale :</b> pH of a solution is the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions in mole per litre. pH = - log[H<sup>+</sup>] <br/>
If pH < 7 then solution is acidic <br/>
If pH > 7 then solution is basic <br/>
If pH = 7 then solution is neutral<br/>
 <b>Importance of pH in everyday life :</b> <br/>
1.	 Our body works within a narrow pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Plants and animals also survive in a narrow range. <br/>
2.	In digestive system : Hydrochloric acid is produced in the stomach which helps in the digestion of food but if it becomes excess, the pH falls, and pain and irritation occurs. To get rid of this ANTACIDS like milk of magnesia (Mg(OH)2) is generally used to adjust the pH. <br/>
3.	In saving tooth decay : Substances like chocolates and sweets are degraded by bacteria present in our mouth. When the pH falls to 5.5 tooth decay starts. Tooth enamel (calcium phosphate) is the hardest substance in our body and it gets corroded. The saliva produced by salivary glands is slightly alkaline, it helps to increase the pH, to some extent, but tooth paste is used to neutralise excess acid in the mouth.  <br/>
<b>Buffer Solution</b>  <br/>
1.	A solution whose pH is not altered to great extent by the addition of small quantities of either an acid (H<sup>+</sup> ions) or a base (OH<sup>-</sup> ions) is called buffer solution. A buffer solution can be obtained by (a) Mixing of weak acid and its salt with a strong base (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>COONa), (b) Mixing of weak base and in salt with strong acid NH<sub>4</sub>OH + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl <br/>
The buffer action of blood is due to the presence of H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup><br/>

<b>Newton’s laws of motion:</b> Newton, the father of physics established the laws of motion in his book “principia” in 1687.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Newton’s first law of motion:</b> Every body maintains its initial state of rest or motion with uniform speed on a straight line unless an external force acts on it.<br/>
•	First law is also called law of Galileo or law of inertia.
•	<b>Inertia:</b> Inertia is the property of a body by virtue of which the body opposes change in its initial state of rest or motion with uniform speed  on a straight line.<br/>
Inertia is of two types 1.Inertia of rest 2. Inertia of motion.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Some example of Inertia:</b><br/>
1.	When a car or train starts suddenly, the passengers bends backward.<br/>
2.	When a running horse stops suddenly, the rider bends forward.<br/>
3.	When a coat/blanket is beaten by a stick, the dust particles are removed.<br/>
<br/>
<big><b>First law gives the definition of force.</b></big><br/>
<b>Force:</b> Force is that external cause which when acts on a body changes or tries to change the initial state of rest or motion with uniform velocity of the body.<br/>
<b>Momentum:</b> Momentum is the property of a moving body and is defined as the product of mass and velocity of the body. i.e<br/>
Momentum= mass×velocity.<br/>
It is vector quantity. Its SI unit is kgm/s.<br/>
<b>Newton’s second law of motion:</b> The rate of change in momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force on the body and takes place in the direction of force.<br/>
If F=force applied, a=acceleration produced and m=mass of body then F=ma.<br/>
•	Newton’s second law gives the magnitude of force.<br/>
•	Newton’s first law is contained in the second law.<br/>
<b>Newton’s Third Law of Motion:</b> To every action, there is an equal and opposite reation.<br/>
<b>Examples of third law</b> – 1.Recoil of a gun 2.Motion of rocket 3.Swimming 4.While drawing water from the well, if the string breaks up the man drawing water falls back.<br/>
<b>Principle of conservation of linear momentum:</b> If no external force acts on a system of bodies, the total momentum of the system of bodies remains constant.<br/>
As a consequence, the total momentum of bodies before and after collision remains the same.<br/>
Rocket works on the principle of conservation of linear momentum.<br/>
<b>Impulse:</b> When a large force acts on a body for very small time, then force is called impulsive force. Impulse is defined as the product of force and time.<br/>
Impulse = force × time = change in momentum.<br/>
It is a vector quantity and its direction is the direction of force. Its SI unit is newton second(Ns).<br/>
<b>Centripetal Force:</b> When a body travels along a circular path, its velocity changes continuously. Naturally an external force always acts on the body towards the centre of the path.<br/>
The external force required to maintain the circular motion of the body is called centripetal force.<br/>
If a body of mass m is moving on a circular path of radius R with uniform speed v, then the required centripetal force,<br/>

<b>Centrifugal Force:</b> In applying the Newton’s laws of motion, we have to consider some forces which can not be assigned to any object in the surrounding. These forces are called psedo force or inertial force.<br/>
Centrifugal force is such a pseudo force. It is equal and opposite to entripetal force.<br/>
•	Cream separator, centrifugal drier work on the principle of centrifugal force.<br/>
•	Centrifugal force should not be confused as the reaction to centripetal force because forces of action and reaction act on different bodies.<br/>
<b>Moment of force:</b> The rotational effect of a force on a body about an axis of rotation is described in terms of moment of force.<br/>
Moment of a force about an axis of rotation is measured as the product of magnitude of force and the perpendicular distance of direction of force from the axis of rotation.<br/>
i.e Moment of force = Force × moment arm<br/>
It is a vector quantity. Its SI unit is newton metre(Nm)
<b>Centre of Gravity:</b> The centre of gravity of a body is that point through which the entire wight of body acts. The centre of gravity of a body does not change with the change in orientation of body in space.<br/>
The weight of a body acts through centre of gravity in the downward direction. Hence a body can be brought to equilibrium by applying a force equal to its weight in the vertically upward direction through centre of gravity.<br/>
<b>Equilibrium:</b> If the resultant of all the forces acting on a body is zero then the body is said to be in equilibrium.<br/>
If a body is in equilibrium, it will be either at rest or in uniform motion. If it is at rest, the equilibrium is called static, otherwise dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
Static equilibrium is of the following three types:<br/>
<b>1.Static Equilibrium:</b> If on slight displacement from equilibrium position, a body has tendency to regain its original position, it is said to be in stable equilibrium.<br/>
<b>2.Unstable equilibrium:</b> If on slight displacement from equilibrium position, a body moves in the direction of displacement and does not regain its original position the equilibrium is said to unstable equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the centre of gravity of the body is at the highest position.<br/>
<b>3.Neutral Equilibrium:</b>If on slight displacement from equilibrium position a body has no tendency to come back to its original position  or to move in the direction of displacement, it is said to be in neutral equilibrium. In neutral equilibrium, the centre of gravity always remains at the same height.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Conditions for stable Equilibrium:</b> For stable equilibrium of a body, the following two conditions should be fulfilled.<br/>
1.The centre of gravity of the body should be at the minimum height.<br/>
2.The vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the body should pass through the base of the body.<br/>

<b>Work:</b> If a body gets displaced when a force acts on it, work is said to be done. Work is measured by the product of force and displacement of the body along the direction of force.<br/>
If a body gets displaced by S when a force F acts on it, then the work W = F S cosθ=0.<br/>
For example, in case of uniform circular motion work done by the centripetal force is zero.<br/>
Work is a scalar quantity and its SI unit is joule.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Energy:</b> Capacity of doing work by a body is called its energy.<br/>
	Energy is a scalar quantity and its SI unit is joule.<br/>
	Energy developed in a body due to work done on it is called mechanical energy.<br/>
	Mechanical energy is of two types: 1.Potential Energy 2.Kinetic Energy.<br/>
	<br/>
<b>Potential Energy:</b> The capacity of doing work developed in a body due to its position or configuration is called its potential energy.<br/>
Example:1 . energy of stretched or compressed spring 2.Energy of water collected at a height 3.Energy of spring in a watch.<br/>
PE of a body in the gravitational field of earth is mgh.<br/>
Where m = mass, g = acceleration due to gravity, h= height of the body form surface of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Kinectic Energy:</b> Energy possessed by a body due to its motion is called Kinetic Energy of the body.
If a body of mass m is moving with speed v, then kinetic energy of the body is 1/2mv<sup>2</sup><br/>
<br/>

<b><big>Principle of Conservation of Energy</big></b><br/>
Energy can neither be created nor can be destroyed. Only energy can be transformed from one form to another form. Whenever energy is utilized in one form, equal amount of energy is produced in other form. Hence total energy of the universe always remains the same. This is called the principle of conservation of energy.

<b>Gravity:</b> The gravitational force of earth is called gravity i.e. gravity is the force by which earth pulls a body towards its centre.<br/>
The acceleration produced in a body due to force of gravity is called acceleration due to gravity and its value is 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. <br/>
•	Acceleration due to gravity is independent of shape, size and mass of the body.<br/>
•	If a man can jump with a velocity v from the surface of earth/planet, height attained by the man is V<sup>2</sup>/2g. The value of g on moon is less than that on earth. Hence on moon, a man can jump higher than earth.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Variation in g</b><br/>
1.	Value of g decreases with height or depth from earth’s surface.<br/>
2.	g is maximum at poles.<br/>
3.	g is minimum at equator.<br/>
4.	 g decreases due to rotation of earth.<br/>
5.	g decreases if angular speed of earth increases and increases if angular speed  of earth decreases.<br/>
If angular speed of earth becomes 17 times its present value, a body on the equator becomes weightless.<br/>

<b>Weight of a body in a lift</b><br/>
1.	If lift is stationary or moving with uniform speed the apparent weight of a body is equal to its true weight.<br/>
2.	If lift is going up with acceleration, the apparent weight of a body is more than the true weight.<br/>
3.	If lift is going down with acceleration, the apparent weight of a body is less than the true weight.<br/>
4.	If the cord of the lift is broken, it falls freely. In this situation the weight of a body in the lift becomes zero. This is the situation of weight lessness.<br/>
5.	While going down, if the acceleration of lift is more than acceleration due to gravity a body in the lift goes in contact of the ceiling of lift.<br/>

<b>Kepler’s Law of planetary motion</b><br/>
1.	All planets move around the sun in elliptical orbits, with the sun being at rest at one focus of the orbit.<br/>
2.	The position vector of the planet with sun at the origin sweeps out equal  area in equal time i.e. The areal velocity of planet around the sun always remains constant.<br/>
A consequence of this law is that the speed of planet increase when the planet is closer to the sun and decreases when the planet is far away from sun.<br/>
Speed of a planet is maximum when it is at perigee and minimum when it is at apogee.<br/>
3.The square of the period of revolution of a planet around the sun is directly proportional to the cube of mean distance of planet from the sun.<br/>

<big><b>Some application of the concept of pressure:</big></b><br/>
•	The bags and suitcase are provided with broad handles so that small pressure is exerted on the hand while carrying them.<br/>
•	Railway tracks are laid on large sized wooden sleepers so that thrust due to weight of train is spread over a large areas.<br/>
•	Pins are made to have pointed ends. This explains why needle is used to brust a gas filled ballon because needle exerts more pressure.<br/>

<b>Atmospheric Pressure:</b> Atmospheric pressure is that pressure which is exerted by a mercury column of 76 cm length at 0<sup>o</sup> C at 45<sup>o</sup> latitude at the sea – level. It is equal to weight of 76cm column of mercury of cross – sectional area 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. Generally it is measured in bar. <br/>
1 bar = 10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>
Atmospheric pressure 1 atm = 1.01 bar = 1.01 × 10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>  = 760 torr.<br/>
One torr is the pressure exerted by a mercury column of 1 mm length.<br/>
•	Atmospheric pressure is measured by barometer. With the help of barometer, weather forecast can be made.<br/>
•	Sudden fall in barometric reading is the indication of rain.<br/>
•	Slow fall in barometric reading is the indication of storm.<br/>
•	Slow rise in the barometric reading is the indication of clear weather.<br/>

<b>Pressure in liquid:</b> Force exerted on unit area of wall or base of the container by the molecules of liquid is the pressure of liquid.<br/>
The pressure exerted by liquid at depth h below the surface of liquid is given as p = hdg where d is the density of liquid.<br/>
Regarding pressure, the following points are worth noting:<br/>
1.	In a static liquid at same horizontal level, pressure is same at all points.<br/>
2.	Pressure at a point in a static liquid has same value in all directions.<br/>
3.	Pressure at a point in a liquid is proportional to the depth of the point from the  free surface.<br/>
4.	Pressure at a point in a liquid is proportional to the density of the liquid.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Pascal law for pressure of liquid</b><br/>
1.	If gravitational attraction is negligible, in equilibrium condition, pressure is same at all points in a liquid.<br/>
2.	If an external pressure is applied to an exclosed fluid, it is transmitted undiminished to every direction.<br/>
Hydrolic lift, hydrolic press, Hydrolic brake work on Pascal law.<br/>

<b>Cohesive Force:</b> The force of attraction between the molecules of same substance is called cohesive force. Cohesive force is maximum in solids. This is why solids have fixed shape. Cohesive force is negligible in case of gases.<br/>

<b>Surface Tension:</b> Surface tension is the property of a liquid by virtue of which it has the tendency to have the area of its area of its free surface minimum as if it were under tension like a stretched elastic membrane.<br/>
A liquid drop attains spherical shape due to surface tension as for given volume, sphere has minimum surface area.<br/>
Surface tension of a liquid is measured by the normal force acting per unit length on either side of an imaginary line drawn on the free surface of liquid and tangential to the free surface.<br/>
So, if a force F acts on an imaginary line of length l, then surface tension, T = F/l.<br/>

<b>Capillarity:</b> If a capillary tube is dipped in a liquid, liquid ascends or descends in the capillary tube. This phenomenon is called capillarity.<br/>
The height by which liquid ascends or decends in a capillary tube depends upon the radius of the tube.<br/>
The capillarity depends on the nature of liquid and solid both. The liquid which wets the wall of tube rises in the tube and the liquid which does not wet the wall of tube descends in the tube. For example , when a glass capillary tube is dipped when a glass capillary tube is dipped in mercury, mercury decends in the tube and shape of mercury meniscus is convex.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Illustrations of capillarity</b><br/>
1.	A piece of blotting paper soaks ink because the pores of the blotting paper serve as capillary tubes.<br/>
2.	The oil in the wick of a lamp rises due to capillary action of threads in the wick.<br/>
3.	The root hairs of plants draws water from the soil through capillary action.<br/>
4.	To prevent loss of water due to capillary action, the soil is loosened and split into pieces by the farmers.<br/>
5.	If a capillary tube is dipped in water in an artificial satellite, water rises up to other end of tube because of its zero apparent weight, how long the tube may be.<br/>
6.	Action of towel in soaking up water from the body is due to capillary action of cotton in the towel.<br/>
7.	Melted wax in a candle rises up to wick by capillary action.<br/>
8.	If a clean and dry needle is kept slowly on the surface of water, it floats due to surface tension.<br/>
9.	The addition of detergent or soap decrease the surface tension of water and thus increases the cleaning ability.<br/>
10.	Bubbles of soap solution are big because addition of soap decreases the surface tension of water.<br/>
11.	When kerosene oil is sprinkled on water, its surface tension decreases. As a result the larva of mosquitoes floating on the surface of water die due to sinking.<br/>
12.	Warm soup is tasty because at high temperature its surface tension is low and consequently the soup spreads on all parts of the tongue.<br/>

<b>Viscous force:</b> The force which opposes the relative motion between different layers of liquid or gases is called viscous force.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Viscosity:</b> Viscosity is the property of a liquid by virtue of which it opposes the relative motion between its different layers.<br/>
•	Viscosity is the property of liquids and gases both.<br/>
•	The viscosity of a liquid is due to cohesive force between its molecules.<br/>
•	The viscosity of a gas is due to diffusion of its molecules from one layer to other layer.<br/>
•	Viscosity of gases is much less than that of liquids. There is no viscosity in solids.<br/>
•	Viscosity of an ideal fluid is zero.<br/>
•	With rise in temperature, viscosity of liquids decreases and that for gases increases.<br/>
•	Viscosity of a fluid is measured by its coefficient of viscosity. Its SI unit is decapoise (kg/ms) or pascal second. It is generally denoted by ƞ.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Terminal Velocity:</b>  When a body falls in a viscous medium, its velocity first increases and finally becomes constant. This constant velocity is called Terminal velocity.<br/>
In this situation, the weight of the body is equal to the sum of viscous force and force of buoyancy i.e. the net force on the body is zero.<br/>
Terminal velocity of a spherical body falling in a viscous medium is proportional to the square of radius of the body.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Streamline Flow:</b> If a fluid is flowing in such a way that velocity of all the fluid particles reaching a particular point is same at all time, then the flow of fluid is said to be streamline flow. Thus in streamline flow, each particle follows the same path as followed by a previous particle passing through that point.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Critical Velocity:</b> The maximum velocity up to which fluid motion is streamline is called critical velocity. Clearly, if the velocity of flow is below critical velocity, flow is streamline and of the velocity is above the critical velocity, flow is turbulent.<br/>
If the velocity of flow is less than critical velocity, the rate of flow of fluid depends basically on viscosity of fluid. If the velocity of flow is more than critical velocity, the rate of flow depends on the density of fluid and not on viscosity. Due to this reason, on eruption of the volcano, the lava coming out of it flows very swiftly although it is very dense having large viscosity.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bernoulli’s theorem:</b> According to Bernoulli’s theorem, in case of streamline flow of incompressible and non viscous fluid through a tube, total energy fluid is same at all points. This theorem is simply the principle of conservation of energy.<br/>
Venturimeter, a device used to measure rate of flow of fluid, work on Bernoulli’s theorem.<br/>

<b>Oscillatory Motion:</b> If a particle repeats its motion after a regular time interval about a fixed point, motion is said to be oscillatory or vibratory. i.e. oscillatory motion is a constrained periodic motion between precisely fixed limits. Motion of piston in an automobile engine, motion of balance wheel of a watch are the examples of oscillatory motion.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Time period:</b> Time taken in one complete oscillation is called time period.<br/>
Or, Time after which motion is repeated is called time period.<br/>
Frequency = Frequency is the no. of oscillations completed by oscillating body in unit time interval. Its SI unit is Hertz.<br/>

<b>Simple Harmonic Motion:</b> If a particle repeats its motion about a fixed point after a regular time interval in such a way that at any moment the acceleration of the particle is directly proportional to its displacement from the fixed point at that moment and is always directed towards the fixed point at that particle is called simple harmonic motion.<br/>
The fixed point is called mean point or equilibrium point.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Characteristics of SHM</b><br/>

<b>Simple Pendulum:</b> If a point mass is suspended from a fixed support with the help of a massless and inextensible string, the arrangement is called simple pendulum. The above is an ideal definition. Practically a simple pendulum is made by suspending a small ball (called bobs) from a fixed support with the help of a light string.<br/>

Wave are broadly of two types<br/>
<b> 1.	Longitudinal wave:</b>  If the particles of the medium vibrate in the direction of propagation of wave, the wave is called longitudinal wave.<br/>
Wave on springs or sound waves in air example of longitudinal wave.<br/>
<b> 2.	Transverse Wave:</b>  If the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave, the wave is called transverse wave.<br/>
Waves on strings under tension, waves on the surface of water are examples transverse waves.<br/>

•	Sound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves. <br/>
•	According to their frequency range, longitudinal mechanical waves are divided into the following categories : <br/>
<br/>
<b>Audible or Sound Waves :</b> The longitudinal mechanical waves which lie in the frequency range 20 Hz to 20000 Hz are called audible or sound waves. These waves are sensitive to human ear. These are generated by the vibrating bodies such as tuning fork, vocal cords etc. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Infrasonic Waves :</b> The longitudinal mechanical waves having frequencies less than 20 Hz are called Infrasonic. These waves are produced by sources of bigger size such as earth quakes, volcanic eruptions, ocean waves and by elephants and whales. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Ultrasonic Waves :</b> The longitudinal mechanical waves having frequencies greater than 20000 Hz are called ultrasonic waves. Human ear can not detect these waves. But certain creatures like dog, cat,. bat, mosquito can detect these waves. Bat not only detect but also produce ultrasonic. <br/>
Ultrasonic waves can be produced by Galton whistle or Hartman generator or by the high frequency vibrations of a quartz crystal under an alternating electric field (Piezo - electric effect) or by the vibrations of a ferromagnetic rod under an alternating magnetic field (Magnetostriction)<br/>
Applications of Ultrasonic Waves <br/>
1.	For sending signals. <br/>
2.	For measuring the depth of sea. <br/>
3.	For cleaning cloths, aeroplanes and machinery parts of clocks. <br/>
4.	For removing lamp-shoot from the chimney of factories.  <br/>
5.	In sterilizing of a liquid. <br/>
6.	In Ultrasonography. <br/>

<b>Speed of Sound :</b> <br/>
•	Speed of sound is different in different mediums. In a medium, the speed of sound basically depends upon elasticity and density of medium. <br/>
•	Speed of sound is maximum in solids and minimum in gases. <br/>
•	When sound enters from one medium to another medium, its speed and wavelength changes but frequency remains unchanged. <br/>
•   In a medium, the speed of sound is independent of frequency.

    <string name="phy30">
<![CDATA[
<b>For example :</b> In case of hydrogen and oxygen, density of oxygen is 16 times that of hydrogen. As a result the velocity of sound in hydrogen is 4 times that in oxygen as other parameters are same. <br/>
•	Wavelength of sound in air is affected by air temperature. <br/>
•	<b>Effect of pressure on speed of sound:</b> The speed of sound is independent of pressure i.e. speed remains unchanged by the increase or decrease of pressure. <br/>
•	<b>Effect of Temperature on speed of sound :</b> The speed of sound increases with the increase of temperature of the medium. The speed of sound in air increases by 0.61 m/ s when the temperature is increased by 1<sup>O</sup>C. <br/>
•	<b>Effect of humidity on speed of sound :</b> The speed of sound is more in humid air than in dry air because the density of humid air is less than the density of dry air. <br/>
•	<b>Characteristics of Sound waves :</b> Sound waves have the following three characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
•	<b>1. Intensity :</b> Intensity of sound at any point in space is defined as amount of energy passing normally per unit area held around that point per unit time. SI Unit of Intensity is watt/m<sup>2</sup><br/>
Intensity of sound at a point is,<br/>
 1. inversely proportional to the square of the distance of point from the source. <br/>
2.directly proportional to square of amplitude of vibration, square of frequency and density of the medium. <br/>

Due to intensity, a sound appears loud or faint to the ear. Actually, the sensation Of a Sound perceived in ear is measured by another term called loudness which depends on intensity of sound and sensitiveness of the ear. Unit of loudness is bel. A Practical unit of loudness is decibel (dB) which of equal to 1 / 10th of bel. Another unit of loudness is phon.<br/>
<b>2. Pitch :</b> Pitch is that characteristic of sound which distinguishes a sharp (or shrill) sound from a grave (dull or flat) sound. Pitch depends upon frequency. Higher the frequency, higher will be the pitch and shriller will be the sound. Lower the frequency, lower will be the pitch and grave will be the sound. <br/>
<br/>
<b>3.Quality :</b> Quality is that characteristic of sound which enables us to distinguish between sounds produced by two sources having the same intensity and pitch. The quality depends upon number, frequency and relative intensities of overtones. <br/>
<b>Echo :</b> The sound waves received after being reflected from a high tower or mountains is called echo.<br/>
•	To hear echo, the minimum distance between the observer and reflector should be 17 m (16.6 m) <br/>

•	Persistence of ear (effect of sound on ear) is 1/10 sec. <br/>

•	Due to refraction, sound is heard at longer distances in nights than in day. <br/>

<b>Resonance :</b> If the frequency of imposed periodic force is equal to the natural frequency of a body, the body oscillates with a very large amplitude. This phenomenon is called resonance.<br/>

<b>Interference of sound :</b> The modification or redistribution of energy at a point due to superposition of two (or, more) sound waves of same frequency is called interference of sound.<br/>
If two waves meet at a point in same phase, intensity of sound is maximum at that point. Such type of interference is called constructive interference. Similarly, if the two waves meet at a point in opposite phase, intensity of sound at that point is minimum. Such type of interference is called destructive interference. <br/>

<b>Stateonary wave :</b> When two progressive waves of same type (ie both longitudinal or both transverse) having the same amplitude and same time period /frequency/ wavelength travelling with same speed along the same straight line in opposite directions, superimpose, a new set of waves are formed which are called stationary of standing waves. <br/>
<br/>

<b>Diffraction of sound :</b> Wavelength of sound is of the order of 1 m. If an obstacle of that range appears in the path of sound, sound deviates at the edge of obstacle and propagates forward. This phenomenon is called diffraction of sound. <br/>

<b>Doppler Effect :</b> If there is a relative motion between source of sound and observer, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the observer is different from the actual frequency of sound emitted by the source. This phenomenon is called Doppler effect.<br/>

When the distance between the source and observer decreases, the apparent frequency increases and vice-versa. <br/>

<b>Mach Number :</b> It is defined as the ratio of speed of source of sound to the speed of sound in the same medium under the same condition of temperature and pressure.<br/>


•	If Mach number > 1, body is called supersonic.<br/>

•	If mach number > 5, body is called hypersonic.<br/>

•	If mach number < 1, the body (source) is said to be moving with subsonic speed.<br/>

<b>Shock waves :</b> A body moving with supersonic speed in air leaves behind it a conical region of disturbance which spreads continuously. Such a disturbance is called shock wave. This wave carries huge energy and may even make cracks in window panes or even damage a building.<br/>

<b>Bow Waves :</b> When a motor boat in a sea travels faster than sound, then waves just like shock-waves are produced on the surface of water. These waves are called bow waves.<br/>

Heat is that form of energy which flows from one body to Other body due to difference is temperature between the bodies. The amount of heat contained in a body depends upon the mass of the body.<br/>
If W work is performed and heat produced is H then W/ H = J or, W = JH where J is a constant called Mechanical Equivalent of Heat. Its value is 4.186 joule / calorie. It means if 4.186 joule of work is performed, 1 calorie of heat is consumed. <br/>

<b>Thermometer :</b> The device which measures the temperature of a body is called thermometer.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Scales of temperature measurement </b><br/>

To measure temperature two fixed points are taken on each thermometer. One of the fixed points is the freezing point of water or ice point as lower fixed point (LFP). The other fixed point is the boiling point of water or steam point as upper fixed print (UFP).<br/>

The temperatures of these fixed points, the no. of fundamental interval between the two fixed points on different temperature scales is shown by the table given below :<br/>

<big><b>Total Radiation Pyrometer</big></b><br/>

When a body is at high temperature, it glows brightly and the colour of radiation emitted by the body is directly proportional to the fourth power of absolute temperature of the body. Radiation pyrometer measures the temperature of a body by measuring the colour of radiation emitted by the body.<br/>

This thermometer is not put in contact with the body. But it can not measure temperature below 8000C because at low temperature emission of radiation is very small and can not be detected.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Specific Heat Capacity :</b> Specific heat capacity of a material is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of substance through 1 0 . Its SI unit is Joule / kilogram kelvin (J / kg.k)<br/>

•	One calorie of heat is required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1<sup>O</sup>C. Hence specific heat capacity of water is 1 cal/ gram <sup>o</sup>C.<br/>

1 calorie/ gram <sup>o</sup>C 4200 Joule / kg kelvin.<br/>

•	For a gas, specific heat capacity can be defined in infinite number of ways as the amount of heat required to increase the temperature depends upon the condition under which gas is being heated.<br/>

The following two specific heats of a gas are of special significance :<br/>

I.	Specific heat of a gas at constant volume (S<sub>v</sub> )<br/>

II.	Specific heat of a gas at constant pressure. (S<sub>p</sub> )<br/>

•	If in place of unit mass, one mole of gas is heated, the heat required to increase the temperature by unity is called molar heat capacity. We have two types of molar heat capacity also<br/>

Clearly, density of water is maximum at 4<sup>0</sup>C.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Transmission of Head :</b> The transfer of heat from one place to other place is called transmission of heat. There are three modes of heat transfer—1. conduction, 2. convection and 3. radiation.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Conduction :</b> In this process, heat is transferred from one place to other place by the successive vibrations of the particles of the medium without bodily movement of the particles of the medium. In solids, heat transfer takes place by conduction.<br/>
Metals are in general good conductor of heat where as brick, concrete, felt, ice, wood, saw dust are bad conductor of heat.

This is why ice is packed in saw dust to save it from being melt.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Convection :</b> In this process, heat is transferred by the actual movement of particles of the movement from one place to other place. Due to movement of particles, a current of particles set up which is called convection current.<br/>
In liquids and gases, heat transfer takes place by convection. <br/>

Earth atmosphere is heated by convection.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Radiation :</b> In this method transfer of heat takes place with the speed of light without affecting the intervening medium. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Newton law of cooling :</b> The rate of loss of heat by a body is directly proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and the surrounding. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Kirchhoff law :</b> According to Kirchhoff law, the ratio of emissive power to absorptive power is same for all surfaces at the same temperature and is equal to emissive power of black body at that temperature.
Kirchhoff law signifies that good absorbers are good emitter.<br/>
If a shining metal ball with some black spot on its surface is heated to a high temperature and seen in dark, the shining ball becomes dull but the black spots shines brilliantly, because black spot absorbs radiation during heating and emit in dark.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Stefan law :</b> The radiant energy emitted by a black body per unit area per unit time (i.e. emissive power) is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.<br/>

<b>Freezing :</b> The process by which a substance is changed from liquid state to solid state is called freezing. Freezing takes at a fixed temperature called freezing point. (F.P.) For a substance M.P.= F.P.<br/>
<br/>
•	M.P. of a substance changes with the change in pressure. Melting point of substances which contracts in the process of fusion (as ice) decreases with the increase in pressure. Melting point of substances which expands in the process of fusion (as wax) increases with the increase in pressure. <br/>
•	With the addition of impurity (as salt in ice), melting point of a substance decreases.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Vapourisation :</b> The process by which a substance is changed from liquid state to vapour state is called vapourisation.<br/>
Vapourisation takes place by two methods :<br/>
 1. Evaporation & 2. Boiling or Ebullition.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Evaporation :</b> The process of vapourisation which takes place only from the exposed surface of liquid and that at all temperatures is called evaporation.<br/>
Evaporation causes cooling. This is why water in a earthed pot gets cooled in summer. <br/>
<br/>
 <b>Boiling :</b> The process of vapourisation which takes place at a fixed temperature and from whole part of liquid is called boiling. <br/>
The temperature at which boiling takes place is called boiling point. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Condensation :</b> The process by which a substance is changed from vapour state to liquid state is called condensation. <br/>
•	Boiling point of a liquid increases with the increase in pressure.<br/>
•	Boiling point of a liquid increases with the addition of impurity.<br/>
<br/>

 <b>Latent heat or heat of transformation </b><br/>
The amount of heat required to change the state of unit mass of substance at constant temperature is called latent heat.<br/>
If Q heat is required to change the state of a substance of mass m at constant temperature and L is the latent heat, then Q = mL.<br/>
S.I. unit of latent heat is Joule/ kilogram. <br/>
Any material has two types of latent heat.<br/>
<br/>
 <b>1. Latent heat of fusion : </b> It is the amount of heat energy required to convert unit mass a substance from solid state to liquid state at its melting point. It is also the amount of heat released by unit mass of liquid when changed into solid at its freezing point.<br/>
<b>Latent heat of vapourisation :</b> It is the amount of heat required to change unit mass of a substance from liquid state to vapour state at its boiling point. It is also the amount of heat released when unit mass of a vapour is changed into liquid.<br/>
<b>Sublimation :</b> Sublimation is the process of conversion of a solid directly into vapour. <br/>
•	Sublimation takes place when boiling point is less than melting point.<br/>
•	Sublimation is shown by camphor or ice in vacuum.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Hoar Frost :</b> Hoar frost is just the reverse process of sublimation i.e. it is the process of direct conversion of vapour into solid.<br/>

Steam produces more severe burn than water at same temperature because internal energy of steam is more than that of water at same temperature (due to latent heat).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Relative Humidity :</b> Relative humidity is defined as the ratio of amount of water vapour present in a given volume of atmosphere to the amount of water vapour required to saturate the same volume at same temperature.<br/>
The ratio is multiplied by 100 to express the relative humidity in percentage. <br/>
•	Relative humidity is measured by Hygrometer.<br/>
•	Relative humidity increases with the increase of temperature.<br/>

<b>Air conditioning :</b> For healthy and favourable atmosphere of human being, the conditions are as follows :<br/>
<b>1. Temperature :</b> from 23<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C.<br/>
<b>2. Relative humidity :</b> from 60% to 65% <br/>

2.	In doing work by the system.<br/>

If ▲Q = heat energy given to the system, ▲U = Increase in the internal energy of the system, ▲W = work done by the system<br/>
Then,▲Q=▲U+▲W is the mathematical statement of first law of thermodynamics.<br/>
•	Internal energy of a system may be potential as well as kinetic energy. The kinetic energy arises due to molecular motion which may be translational, rotational and vibrational.<br/>

•	First law of thermodynamics is equivalent to principle of conservation of energy.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Isothermal Process :</b> If the changes are taking place in a system in such a way that temperature of the system remains constant throughout the change, then the process is said to be isothermal.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Adiabatic Process :</b> If the changes are taking place in a system in such a way that there is no exchange of heat energy between the system and the surrounding, then the process is said to be an adiabatic process.<br/>
If carbon dioxide is suddenly expanded, it is changed into dry ice. This is an example of adiabatic process.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Second Law of Thermodynamics :</b> The first law of thermodynamics guarantees that in a thermodynamic process, energy will be conserved. But this law does not tell whether a given process in which energy is conserved will take place or not. The second law of thermodynamics gives the answer.<br/>

Through this law can be stated in many forms, the following two forms are worth mentioning : <br/>
<br/>

<b>Kelvin statement :</b> Whole of the heat can never be converted into work.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Clausius statement :</b> Heat by itself can not flow from a body at lower temperature to a body at higher temperature.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Heat Engine :</b> Heat engine is a device which converts heat energy into mechanical work continuously through a cyclic process. Every heat engine basically consists of the three parts : 1. source (a hot body)2. sink (a cold body) and 3. a working substance.<br/>
Heat engine may be divided into two types : <br/>
<br/>
<b>Internal Combustion Engine :</b> In this engine, heat is produced in the engine itself. Example : Otto engine or petrol engine (efficiency 52%), Diesel engine (efficiency = 64%)<br/>
<br/>
<b>External Combustion Engine :</b> In this engine heat is produced outside the engine.<br/>

Steam engine is an example of external combustion engine. (efficiency = 20%) <br/>
<br/>
<b>Reversible/ Carnot Heat Engine :</b> An ideal heat engine which is tree from all the imperfections of practical irreversible heat engine is called Carnot Heat Engine.<br/>

The working substance of ideal heat engine undergoes a cycle of operation called Carnot Cycle. Efficiency of ideal Carnot heat <br/>

Light is a form of energy which is progapated as electromagnetic wave. In the spectrum of electromagnetic waves it lies between ultra-violet and infra-red region and has wavelength between 3900 A<sup>o</sup> to 7800 A<sup>o</sup>.<br/>
•	Electromagnetic waves are transverse, hence light is transverse wave .<br/>
•	Wave nature of light explains rectilinear propagation, reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction and polarization of light.<br/>
•	The phenomena like photoelectric effect, compton effect are not explained on the basis of wave nature of light. These phenomena are explained on the basis of quantum theory of light as proposed by Einstein.<br/>
•	In quantum theory, light is regarded as a packet or bundle of energy called photon. Photon is associated with it an energy E where E = hv. <br/>
•	Clearly light behaves as wave and particle both. Thus light has dual nature. <br/>
•	Speed of light was first measured by Roemer. (1678 AD). <br/>

<b>Luminous bodies :</b> Those object which emit light by themselves are called luminous bodies.<br/>
e.g.—sun, stars, electric bulb etc.
<b>Non-luminous bodies :</b> Those objects which do not emit light by themselves but are visible by the light falling on them emitted by self luminous bodies are called non-luminous bodies.<br/>
<br/>
A material can be classified as : <br/>
<b>1.	Transparent :</b> The substances which allow most of the incident light to pass through them are called transparent. e.g. glass, water.<br/>
<b>2.	Translucent:</b>The substances which allow a part of incident light to pass through them are called translucent bodies e.g. oiled paper. <br/>
<b>3.	Opaque :</b> The substances which do not allow the incident light to pass through them are called opaque bodies. e.g., mirror, metal, wood etc. <br/>

Refraction of light: When a ray of light propagating in a medium enters the other medium, it deviates from its path. This phenomenon of change in the direction of propagation of light at the boundary when it passes from one medium to other medium is called refraction of light. <br/>
When a ray of light enters from rarer medium to denser medium (as from water to glass) it deviates towards the normal drawn on the boundary of two media at the incident point. Similarly in passing from denser to rarer medium, a ray deviates away from the normal. If light is incident normally on the boundary i.e. parallel to normal, it enters the second medium undeviated. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Laws of refraction</b><br/>

        •	Therefractiveindex ofamediumis differentfordifferentcolours. Therefractive index of a medium decreases with the increase in wavelength of light. Hence refractive index of a medium is maximum for violet colour of light and minimum for red colour of light.<br/>
•	 The refractive index of a medium decreases with the increase in temperature. But this variation is very small.<br/>
•	When a ray of light enters from one medium to other medium, its frequency and phase donot change but wavelength and velocity change. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Some illustrations of Refraction</b> <br/>
1.	Bending of a linear object when it is partially dipped in a liquid inclined to the surface of the liquid. <br/>
2.	Twinkling of stars.<br/>
3.	Oval shape of sun in the morning and evening. <br/>
4.	An object in a denser medium when seen from a rarer medium appears to be at a smaller distance.<br/>

This is way (a) A fish in a pond when viewed from air appears to be at a smaller depth them actual depth (b) A coin at the base of a vessel filled with water appears raised. <br/>
•	The refractive index is proportional to wavelength. So shooter the wavelength, the less it refracts (deviates). Hens if a glass slab is place over coloured letters, violet letter having shortest wavelength will appeared less raised then any other colour. Red colour being of longest wavelength will appeared most raised. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Critical angle :</b> In case of propagation of light from denser to rarer medium through a plane boundary, critical angle is the angle of incidence for which angle of refraction is 90<sup>o</sup>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Total Internal Reflection :</b> If light is propagating from denser medium towards the rarer medium and angle of incidence is more than critical angle, then the light incident on the boundary is reflected back in the denser medium, obeying the laws of reflection. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection as total light energy is reflected, no part is absorbed or transmitted. <br/>
•	For total internal reflection, <br/>
1.Light must be propagating from denser to rarer medium. <br/>
This is why if light goes from water to glass, total internal reflection will not take place.<br/>
2.Angle of incidence must exceeds the critical angle.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Illustrations of total internal reflection</b> <br/>
1.Sparkling of diamond <br/>
2.Mirage and looming. <br/>
3.Shining of air bubble in water. <br/>
4.Increase in duration of sun visibility—The sun becomes visible even before sun rise and remains visible even after sunset due to total internal reflection of light. <br/>
5.Shining of a smoked ball or a metal ball on which lamp soot is deposited when dipped in water. <br/>

<b>6.Optical Fibre :</b> Optical fibre consists of thousands of strands of a very fine quality glass or quartz (of refractive index 1.7), each strand coated with a layer of material of lower refractive index (1.5). In it, light is propagated along the axis of fibre through multiple total internal reflection, even though the fibre is curved, without loss of energy. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Applications : </b><br/>
1.For transmitting optical signals and the two dimensional pictures. <br/>
2.For transmitting electrical signals by first converting them to light. <br/>
3.For visualising the internal sites of the body by doctors in endoscopy.<br/>

<b>Refraction of Light Through Lens </b><br/>
•	Lens is a section of transparent refractive material of two surfaces of definite geometrical shape of which one surface must be spherical. Lens is generally of two types : <br/>
1. Convex lens 2. Concave lens.<br/>
•	When a lens is thicker at the middle than at the edges, it is called a convex lens or a converging lens. When the lens is thicker at the edges than in the middle, it is called as concave lens or diverging lens.<br/>

        <b>Power of a lens </b><br/>
	Power of a lens is its capacity to deviate a ray. It is measured as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters, i.e. P = 1/f<br/>
SI Unit of power is dioptre (D). <br/>
	Power of a convex lens is positive and that of a concave lens is negative. <br/>
	If two lenses are placed in contact, then the power of combination is equal to the sum of powers of individual lenses.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Change in the power of a lens :</b> If a lens is dipped in a liquid, its focal length and power both change. This change depends upon the refractive indices of lens and the liquid. If a lens of refractive index µ is dipped in a liquid of refractive index µ., then the following three situations are possible<br/>
1.	µ > µ. i.e. lens is dipped in a liquid of smaller refractive index like a lens of glass (µ = 1.5) is dipped in water (µ. = 1.33), then the focal length of the lens increases and the power of the lens decreases. <br/>

2.	µ= µ. i.e. lens is dipped in a liquid of equal refractive index then the focal length of the lens becomes infinite i.e. its power becomes zero. The lens and the liquid behave as a single medium. <br/>

3.	µ < µ. i.e. lens is dipped in a liquid of higher refractive index the focal length increases i.e. power decreases as well as the nature of the lens also changes i.e. convex lens behaves as concave lens and vice-versa. For example, an air bubble trapped in water or glass appears as convex but behaves as concave lens. Similarly a convex lens of glass (g = 1.5) when dipped in carbon disulphide (P 1.68), it behaves as a concave lens. <br/>

<b>Dispersion of Light :</b> When a ray of white light (or a composite light) is passed through a prism, it gets splitted into its constituent colours. This phenomenon is called dispersion of light. The coloured pattern obtained on a screen after dispersion of light is called spectrum.<br/>

•	The dispersion of light is due to different deviation suffered by different colours of light. The deviation is maximum for violet colour and minimum for red colour of light. The different colours appeared in the spectrum are on the following order, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. (VIBGYOR) <br/>
•	The dispersion of light is due to different velocities of light of different colours in a medium. As a result, the refractive index of a medium is different for different colours of light.<br/>

•	The velocity of light in a medium is maximum for that colour for which refractive index is minimum. Clearly, the velocity of violet colour of light is minimum in a medium and retroactive index of that medium is maximum for violet colour. Similarly, the velocity of light in a medium is maximum for red colour and refractive index of that medium is minimum for red colour. <br/>

<b>Scattering of light :</b> When light waves fall on small bodies such as dust particles, water particles in suspension, suspended particles in colloidal solution, they are thrown out in all directions. This phenomenon is called scattering of light.<br/>

Scattering of light is maximum in case of violet colour and minimum in case of red colour of light.<br/>
•	Blue colour of sky is due to scattering of light.
•	The brilliant red colour of rising and setting sun is due to scattering of light.

<b>Interference of light :</b> When two light waves of exactly the same frequency and a constant phase difference travel in same direction and superimpose then the resultant intensity in the region of superposition is different from the sum of intensity of individual waves. This modification in the intensity of light in the region of superposition is called interference of light. Interference is of two types <br/>
1. Constructive interference 2. Destructive interference <br/>
<br/>
<b>Constructive interference :</b> At some points, where the two waves meet is same phase, resultant intensity is maximum. Such interference is called constructive interference. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Destructive interference :</b> At some points, where the two waves meet in opposite phase, resultant intensity is minimum. Such interference is called destructive interference. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Diffraction of light :</b> When light waves fall on a small sized obstacle or a small aperture whose dimension is comparable to the wavelength of light, then there is a departure from the rectilinear propagation and light energy flavours out into the region of geometrical shadow. The spreading of light energy beyond the limit prescribed by rectilinear propagation of light is called diffraction of light. In other words, diffraction is the process by which a beam of light or other systems of wave is spread out as a result of passing through a narrow opening or across an edge.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Polarisation of light :</b> Polarisation is the only phenomenon which proves that light is a transverse wave. Light is an electromagnetic wave in which electric and magnetic field vectors vibrate perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In ordinary light, the vibrations of electric field vector are in every plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave. Polarisation is the phenomenon of restricting the vibrations of a light in a particular direction in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave.<br/>
The visible effect of light is only due to electric field vector.<br/>

<b>Human Eye</b><br/>

•	Human eye basically consists of a convex lens. This lens forms real and inverted image of an object on retina.<br/>
•	There are two kinds of vision cells in the retina. They are called rods and cones on account of their peculiar shape. Rods decides the intensity of light where as cones distinguish colour of light.<br/>
•	Least distance of distinct vision is 25 cm.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Defects of human eye and the remedies :</b><br/>
1.Myopia or short sightedness : A person suffering from myopia can see the near objects clearly while far objects are not clean <br/>
<br/>
Causes :<br/>
i.	Elongation of eye ball along the axis.<br/>
ii.	Shortening of focal length of eye lens.<br/>
iii.	Over stretching of ciliary muscles beyond the elastic limit.<br/>
<b>Remedy :</b> Diverging lens is used.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. Hyperopia or hypermetropia or longsightedness :</b> A person suffering from hypermetropia can see the distant objects clearly but not the near objects. <br/>
Causes :<br/>
a.	Shortening of eye ball along the axis. <br/>
b.	Increase in the focal length of eye lens.<br/>
c.	Stiffening of ciliary muscles. <br/>
            Remedy : A converging lens is sued. <br/>
  <br/>
<b>3.Presbyopia :</b> This defect is generally found in elderly person. Due to stiffening of ciliary muscles, eye looses much of its accommodating power. As a result distinct as well as nearby objects can not be seen.<br/>
For its remedy two separate lens or a bifocal lens is used.<br/>
<br/>
<b>4.Astigmatism :</b> This defect arises due to difference in the radius of curvature of cornea in the different planes. As a result point in one plane of an object appear in focus while those in other plane are out of focus. For its remedy cylindrical lens is used.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Simple microscope :</b> This is simply a convex lens of small focal length. The object to be enlarged is placed within the focus of lens. <br/>
Magnifying power of a simple microscope is given as<br/>
 M = 1 + D/f where D = 25 cm, f = focal length of lens.<br/>
 <br/>
<b> Compound microscope :</b> It consists of two convex lenses coaxially fitted in a hollow tube. The lens facing the object is called objective and the lens towards the eye is called eye piece.<br/>
•	The aperture of objective is smaller than that of eye piece.<br/>
•	Both the lenses are of smaller focal lengths. This increases the magnifying power of instrument.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Electron Microscope</b><br/>
Electron microscope uses the beam of accelerated electrons as a source of illumination. As the wavelength of electron is shorter than that of visible light, the electron microscope has a higher resolving power.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Telescope</b><br/>
Telescopes are used to view distant objects which are not visible to naked eye. Telescope can be divided as astronomical telescope, terrestrial telescope and Galilean telescope.<br/>
•	Astronomical telescope consists of two convex lenses placed coaxially in a hollow tube. The lens facing the object is called objective and the lens towards the eye is called eye piece. <br/>
•	The objective has large aperture so that the rays from the object can be easily collected.<br/>
•	The focal length of objective is larger than that of eye piece.<br/>
•	Terrestrial Telescope is similar to astronomical telescope with one additional convex lens in between the objective and eye piece. The role of eye piece is to invert the image formed by the objective so that the final image is erect.<br/>
•	Galilean telescope consists of two lenses. The objective is convex and eye piece is concave.<br/>
•	Optical telescope was invented by Hans Lippershey. But Galileo Galilei was first to use it systematically to study the night sky.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Movie (Film) or Slide Projector :</b> <br/>
It projects magnified image of an Object on a screen. The object (inverted) is placed between F and 2F of a projection lens (a convex lens) so that its real, inverted, magnified image is formed between 2F and infinity on the other side ie. the image is erect.

<b>Surface density of charge :</b> Surface density of charge is defined as the amount of charge per unit area on the surface of conductor. <br/>

•	The surface denqity of charge at a point on the surface of conductor depends upon the shape of conductor and presence of other conductors or insulators near the given conductor.<br/>
•	The surface density of charge at any part of the conductor is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature of the surface of that part.<br/>
•	 This is why surface density of charge in maximum at the pointed parts of the conductor. <br/>
•	Conductor : Conductors are those materials which allow electricity (charge) to pass through themselves. Good conductor have loosely bound electrons.<br/>
	Examples : (a) Metals like silver, iron, copper (b) Earth (especially the moist part) acts like a huge conductor.<br/>
•	Silver is the best conductor. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Insulator or Dielectric :</b> Insulators are those materials which do not allow electricity to flow through themselves.<br/>
Examples:  Wood, paper, mica, glass, ebonite. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Coulomb law :</b> According to Coulomb law, the force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges at rest is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This force acts on the line joining the two charges. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Electric Field :</b> Region in space around a charge or charged body where the charge has its electrical effect is called electric field of the charge. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Electric Field Intensity :</b> Electric field intensity at a point in an electric field is the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed at that point. <br/>
<br/>

<b>Electric Field of hollow conductor</b> <br/>

Electric field intensity inside a charged hollow conductor is zero. Charge given to such a conductor (or conductor of any shape) remains on its surface only.<br/>
This explains why a hollow conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. It is for this reason that it is safer to sit in a car or bus during lightning. <br/>


<b>Electric Potential :</b> Electric potential at a point in an electric field is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point.<br/>
SI unit of electric potential is volt. It is a scalar quantity.<br/>

<b>Potential Difference :</b> Work done in bringing a unit positive charge from one point to other point is the potential difference between the two points. Its SI unit is volt and is a scalar quantity.<br/>

<b>Electric Capacity :</b> Electric capacity of a conductor is defined as the charge required to increase the potential of the conductor by unity. If potential of a conductor is increased by V when a charge Q is given to it, capacity of the conductor is Q/V. Its SI unit is farad. (F) <br/>

<b>Electrochemical Cell :</b> Electrochemical cell is a device which converts chemical energy into electrical energy.<br/>
Cells are basically of two types : 1. Primary cell 2. Secondary cell.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Primary Cell :</b> In primary cell electrical energy is obtained from the irreversible chemical reaction taking inside the cell. After complete discharge, primary cell becomes unserviceable.<br/>
<b>Examples :</b> Voltaic Cell, Leclanche Cell, Daniel Cell, Dry Cell etc. <br/>


<b>Secodnary Cell :</b> A secondary cell is that which has to be charged at first from an external electric source and then can be used to draw current. Such cells are rechargeable.<br/>
<br/>
•	Production of electricity by chemical reaction was first discovered by Allexandro de volta (voltaic cell is named after him) in 1794. In voltaic cell zinc rod is used as cathode and copper rod is used as anode. These rods are placed in sulphuric acid kept in a glass vessel.<br/>

•	In a Leclanche cell, carbon rod acts as anode and zinc rod acts as cathode. These rods are placed in amonium chloride kept in a glass vessel. <br/>

•	The emf of Leclanche cell is 1.5 volt.<br/>

•	Leclanche cell is used for intermittent works. i.e. works in which continuous electrical energy is not required like electric bell. <br/>

•	In a dry cell, mixture of MnO , NH Cl and carbon is kept in a zinc vessel. A carbon rod is placed in the mixture which acts as anode. The zinc vessel itself acts as cathode. The emf of dry cell is 1.5 volt.<br/>

•	Magnetism is the property displayed by magnets and produced by the movement of electric charges, which results in objects being attracted or pushed away.<br/>
•	Magnet is a piece of iron or other materials that can attract iron containing objects and that points north and south when suspended.<br/>
•	A magnet is characterised by following two properties :<br/>
<b>1.	Attractive property :</b> A magnet attracts magnetic substances like iron, cobalt, nickel and some of their alloys like magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>   O<sub>4</sub>)<br/>
<b>2.	Directive property :</b> When a magnet is freely suspended, it aligns itself in the geographical north south direction.<br/>
•	A magnet may be 1. Natural 2. Artificial<br/>
•	Natural magnet is oxide of iron. But due to irregular shape, weak magnetism and high brittleness, natural magnets find no use in the laboratory.<br/>
•	The magnets made by artificial methods are called artificial magnets or man made magnets. They may be of different types like bar magnet, horse shoe magnet, Robinson ball ended magnet, magnetic needle, electromagnet etc.<br/>
•	The two points near the two ends of a magnet where the attracting capacity is maximum are called magnetic poles. When a magnet is freely suspended, its one pole always directs towards the north. This pole is called north pole. The other pole is called south pole.<br/>
•	The imaginary line joining the two poles of a magnet is called magnetic axis of the magnet.<br/>
•	Similar poles repel each other and dissimilar poles attract each other.<br/>
•	When a magnetic substance is placed rear a magnet, it gets magnetised due to induction.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Magnetic Field :</b> Region in space around a magnet where the magnet has its magnetic effect is called magnetic field of the magnet. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Intensity of magnetic field or magnetic flux density :</b> Magnetic flux density of a point in a magnetic field is the force experienced by a north pole of unit strength placed at that point. Its SI unit is newton/ ampere-meter or weber/ meter<sup>2</sup> or tesla(T).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Magnetic lines of force :</b> The magnetic lines of force are imaginary curves which represent a magnetic field graphically. The tangent drawn at any point on the magnetic liens of force gives the direction of magnetic field at that point.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Properties of magnetic liens of force : </b><br/>

1.	Magnetic lines of force are closed curves. Outside the magnet they are from north to south pole and inside the magnet they are from south to north pole.<br/>
2.	Two lines of force near intersect each other.<br/>

<b>Examples:</b> Bismuth, Zinc, Copper, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Water, Mercury, Water etc.<br/>
<br/>
2.	<b>Paramagnetic Substance :</b> Paramagnetic substances are such substances which when placed in a magnetic field acquire a feeble magnetism in the direction of the field.<br/>
<b>Examples :</b>  Aluminum, Platinum, Manganese, Sodium, Oxygen etc.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.	Ferromagnetic Substance :</b> Ferromagnetic substances are those substance, which when placed in a magnetic field, are strongly magnetised in the direction of field.<br/>
<b>Examples :</b> Iron, Cobalt, Nickel etc.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Domain :</b> Atoms of ferromagnetic substance have a permanent dipole moment i.e. they behave like a very small magnet. The atoms form a large no. of effective regions called domain in which 10<sup>18</sup> to 10<sup>21</sup> atoms have their dipole moment aligned in the same direction. The magnetism in ferromagnetic substance, when placed in a magnetic field, is developed due to these domain by I. the displacements of boundaries of the domains 2. the rotation of the domains. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Curie Temperature :</b> As temperature increases, the magnetic property of ferromagnetic substance decreases and above a certain temperature the substance changes into paramagnetic substance. This temperature is called Curie temperature.<br/>
•	Permanent magnets are made of steel, cobalt steel, ticonal, alcomax and alnico. <br/>
•	Electromagnets, cores of transformers, telephone diaphragms, armatures of dynamos and motors are made of soft iron, mu-metal and stalloy.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Terrestrial Magnetism :</b> Our earth behaves as a powerful magnet whose south pole is near the geographical north pole and whose north pole is near the geographical south pole. The magnetic field of earth at a place is described in the terms of following three elements. <br/>
<b>1. Declination :</b> The acute angle between magnetic meridian and geographical meridian at a place is called the angle of declination at that place. <br/>
<b>2.	Dip or Inclination :</b> Dip is the angle which the resultant earth magnetic field at a place makes with the horizontal. At poles and equator, dip is 90<sup>o</sup> and 0<sup>o</sup> respectively. <br/>
<b>3.	Horizontal component of earth magnetic field :</b> At a place it is defined as the component of earth magnetic field along the horizontal in the magnetic meridian. <br/>
<br/>
Its valve is different at different places. (approximately 0.4 gauss or 0.4 x 10<sup>-4</sup> tesla). <br/>
<br/>
<b>Magnetic Maps :</b> Magnetic maps are the geographical maps on which the values of three magnetic elements of earth are represented. On the magnetic maps, following lines are important : <br/>
<b>Isogonic lines:</b> The lines joining the places of same declination are called isogonic lines.<br/>
<b>Agonic line :</b>The line joining the places of zero declination is called agonic line. Isoclinic lines : The lines joining the places of same dip are called isoclinic lines, Aclinic line : The line joining the places of zero dip is called aclinic line or magnetic equator. <br/>
<b>Isodynamic lines :</b> The lines joining the places of same value of horizontal component of earth magnetic field are called isodynamic lines. <br/>

<b>cathode Rays :</b> If the gas pressure in a discharge tube is 10<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>-3</sup> mm of Hg and a potential difference of 10 volt is applied between the electrode, then a beam of electrons emerges from the cathode which is called cathode rays.

<b>Radioactivity</b><br/>

•	Radioactivity is the sending out of harmful radiation or particles, caused when atomic nuclei breakup spontaneously.<br/>

•	Radioactivity was discovered by Henry Becquerel for which he received the Novel Prize of Physics jointly with Madame Curie and Pierre Curie.<br/>

•	The nucleus having protons 83 or more are unstable. They emit α,β and γ particles and become stable. The elements of such nucleus are called radioactive elements and the phenomenon of emission of α, β and γ particles is called radioactivity.<br/>

•	β rays are fast moving electrons. In the nucleus an electron is created due to conversion of neutron into proton. <br/>

•	ϒ rays are electromagnetic waves. ϒ rays are emitted after the emission of a and β rays. <br/>

<b>Nuclear Fission and Fusion</b> <br/>
A nucleus is represented as ZXAwhere Z is the number of proton (called atomic number), A is sum of number of protons (Z) and number of neutrons (N) and is called mass number <br/>
Number of neutrons N = A — Z <br/>
For example, <sub>92</sub>U<sup>238</sup> has 92 protons, 238 — 92 146 neutrons and 238 nucleons (protons + neutrons). <br/>
<br/>
<b>Nuclear Fission :</b> The nuclear reaction in which a heavy nucleus splits into two nuclei of nearly equal mass is nuclear fission. The energy released in the nuclear fission is called nuclear energy. <br/>
•	Nuclear fission was first demonstrated by Strassmann and O. Hahn. They found that when U 235 nucleus is excited by the capture of a neutron, it splits into two nuclei Ba<sup>142</sup> & K<sup>92</sup> <br/>
<br/>
<b>Chain Reaction :</b> When uranium atom is bombarded with slow neutrons, fission takes place. With the fission of each uranium nucleus, on the average 3 neutrons and large energy is released. These neutrons cause further fission. Clearly a chain of fission of uranium nucleus starts which continues till whole of uranium is exhausted. This is called chain reaction. <br/>


Chain reaction is of the following two types 1. Uncontrolled chain reaction 2. Controlled chain reaction. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Uncontrolled Chain Reaction :</b> In each fission reaction, three more neutrons are produced. These three neutrons may cause the fission of three other U<sup>235</sup> nuclei producing 9 neutrons and so on. As a result the number of neutron goes on increasing till the whole of fissionable material is consumed. This chain reaction is called uncontrolled or explosive chain reaction. This reaction proceeds very quickly and a huge amount of energy is liberated in a short time.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Atom bomb :</b> Atom bomb is based on nuclear fission. U<sup>235</sup> and Pu <sup>239</sup> are used as fissionable material. This bomb was first used by USA against Japan in second World war (6th August, 1945 at Hiroshima & 9th August, 1945 at Nagashaki).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Controlled Chain Reaction :</b> A fission chain reaction which proceeds slowly without any explosion and in which the energy released can be controlled is known as controlled reaction. Actually in this situation only one of the neutrons produced in each fission is able to cause further fission. In controlled chain reaction, the rate of reaction remains constant. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Nuclear Reactor or Atomic Pile :</b> Nuclear reactor is an arrangement in which controlled nuclear fission reaction takes place. <br/>
•	First nuclear reactor was established in Chicago University under the supervision of Prof. Fermi. <br/>
•	There are several components of nuclear reactor which are as follows : <br/>

<b>1. Fissionable Fuel :</b> U<sup>235</sup> or U<sup>239</sup> is used. <br/>

<b>2. Moderator :</b> Moderator decreases the energy of neutrons so that they can be further used for fission reaction. Heavy water and graphite are used as moderator. <br/>
<b>3.Control rod :</b> Rods of cadmium or boron are used to absorb the excess neutrons produced in fission of uranium nucleus so that the chain reaction continues to be controlled. <br/>
<b>4.Coolant:</b> A large amount of heat is produced during fission. Coolant absorbs that heat and prevents excessive rise in the temperature. The coolant may be water, heavy water (D<sup>2</sup>O — deuterium ( <sub>1<sub>H<sup>2</sup>) is an isotope of hydrogen). or a gas like He or CO<sup>2</sup> <br/>

 <b>Uses of nuclear reactor</b> <br/>
1.	To produce electrical energy from the energy released during fission. <br/>
2.	To produce different isotopes which can be used in medical, physical and agriculture science.<br/>
 <b>Fast Breeder Reactor :  </b>A nuclear reactor which can produce more fissionable fuel than it consumes is called a fast breeder reactor.<br/>
 <b>Nuclear Fusion :</b> When two or more light nuclei combined together to form a heavier nucleus, tremendous energy is released. This phenomenon is called nuclear fusion. <br/>
 A typical example of nuclear fission is

<b>Electronics :</b> Electronics is the branch of physics and technology concerned with the behaviour and movement of electrons.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Electron Emission :</b> <br/>
In metals, the electrons from the outermost orbit of atom become free at room temp. However these free electrons can not leave the surface of metals. For the free electrons to leave the metal surface, external energy is required. Electron emission can be achieved by the following methods. <br/>
<b>1.	Thermionic Emission :</b> by heating the metal. <br/>
<b>2.	Photo-electric emission :</b> By illuminating the metal surface with light (electromagnetic waves like ultraviolet rays) ofsuitable frequency. The electrons so emitted are called photo electrons <br/>
<b>3.	Secondary emission :</b> It is the electron emission when highly energetic electron beam is incident on a metal surface. The electron so emitted are called secondary electron. <br/>
<b>4.	Field or cold emission :</b> This is the process of electron emission by applying a strong electric field across the metal surface.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Diode Valve :</b> Designed by J. A. Fleming in 1904, diode valve consists of two electrodes placed inside an evacuated glass envelope. One electrode is called cathode which is made up of tungsten on which there is a thin layer of barium oxide. When heated, cathode emits electrons. These electron flow towards the other electrode called anode or plate, which is at positive potential. As a result an electric current is established in the circuit. <br/>
•	The electrons emitted from the cathode are collected in the evaluated space around it. This collection of electrons is called space charge which is obviously negative.<br/>
•	Diode valve acts a rectifier. Rectifier is a device which converts alternating voltage (current) into direct voltage (current).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Triode Valve :</b> Designed by Lee de Forest in 1907, triode valve is a modified form Of usual diode. It consists of a usual anode - cathode pair and one more electrode called control grid. <br/>
•	Triode valve can be used as amplifier, oscillator, transmitter and detector. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Semi-conductor:</b> Semi conductor are those materials whose electrical conductivity, at room temperature, lies in between that of insulator and conductor. Germenium and Silicon are two important semiconductor. In a crystal lattice of semi-conductor, some of the electrons become free from bond formation. At the sites of these electrons a deficiency of electron exists which acts as a virtual positive charge. These virtual positive charges are called holes. Semi-conductors are used in electronics industry.
 Semi-conductors are of two types :<br/>
<b>1.	Intrinsic Semi-Conductor :</b> A semi conductor in an extremely pure form is known as intrinsic semi conductor. At absolute zero, an intrinsic semi conductor is a perfect insulator. (conductivity = zero).<br/>
<b>2.	Extrinsic Semi-Conductor :</b> If a measured and small amount of chemical impurity is added to intrinsic semi-conductor, it is called extrinsic semi conductor or doped semi conductor. As a result of doping, there is large increase in its conductivity. <br/>

•	Extrinsic semi conductor are of two types :<br/>
<b>a.	N type semi conductor :</b> An extrionic semi conductor in which electrons are majority charge carrier is called N type semi conductor. Such a semi conductor is made by doping a pure semi conductor with pentavalent impurity like Arsenic, Antimony & Phosphorus. <br/>
<br/>
<b>b.	P type semi conductor :</b> An extrinsic semi conductor in which holes are the majority charge carrier is called a P type semi conductor. Such a semi conductor is made by doping a pure semi conductor with trivalent impurity like Gallium, Indium, Boron and Aluminium. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Doping :</b> Adding of chemical impurity to a pure semi conductor is called doping. The amount and type of impurity is closely controlled.<br/>
<b> Donor :</b> Pentavalent impurities are called donor. <br/>
<b>Acceptor :</b> Trivalent impurities are called acceptor. <br/>
 The electrical conductivity of a semi conductor increases with the increase in temperature.<br/>
<b>Rectifier :</b> Rectifier is a device which converts alternating current into direct current. <br/>

•There are millions of organisms. It is impossible to study each individual separately. Classification means to categories organism into different groups. Study of an individual of a group us the idea of rest of the member of that group.<br/>
•Linnaeus divide all organism into two kingdoms – Panate and Animalia in his book “Systema Nature”. The foundation of modern classification system was laid in the line of classification system started by Linnaeus. Therefore Linnaeus is called ‘Father of Taxonomy’. Due to disputed position of organism like bacteria, virus, fungi and euglena, there is a need of reconsideration of system of classification.<br/>
•The book ‘Genera plantarium’ was written by Benthem and Hooker.<br/>

<b>Main feautures of the cell theory:</b><br/>
1. All organism are composed of cell.<br/>
2. Body of every organism is made of cell.<br/>
3. Each cell arises from pre-existing cell.<br/>
4. Every organism starts its life from single cell.<br/>

<b>Cell is of two kinds</b><br/>
<b>1.Prokaryotic cell:</b> These are primitive cell having three basic structure of typical cell but lack nuclear membrane. Nuclear material is present in a region of cytoplasm called nucleoid. Other membrane bound organelles are absent such as mitochondria, lysosome, golgi bodies etc. Ex- Virus, bacteria and cynobacteria are Prokaryotes.<br/>
Number of Mitochondria in bacterial cell is zero.<br/>
The smallest known prokaryotic organism is Mycoplasma.<br/>
<b>2.Eukaryotic cell:</b> Thses are complete cell which contain membrane bound organelles and nucleus. Unicellular and multicellular plant and animal have Eukaryotic cell.<br/>
The biggest single called organism is Acetabularia.<br/>
Nucleus contain chromatin made up of DNA and histone protein.<br/>
Nucleolus is present inside nucleus.<br/>

<b>Difference between Prokaryotes and Eurkaryotes</b>

<b>Structure of typical cell:</b> A cell have following structure.<br/>
<b>Cell wall:</b> In plant cell there is a rigid cell wall which is non living and freely permeable. It is made up of cellulose or chitin. It provide shape and rigidity to the cell.<br/>
Cell wall of bacteria is made up of peptidoglycan.<br/>
<b>Cell membrane:</b> It is also known as plasma membrane which form theouter covering of animal cell. In plant cell it is found within cell wall. It is thin, elastic, living, double layer, permeable membrane. It is made up of phospholipid molecules.<br/>
<b>Protoplasm:</b> The whole fluid present inside plasma membrane is protoplasm. The name protoplasm is given by Purkenje in 1839. Protoplasm is made up of various chemical substance like water, ions salt and organic molecule. It is the living part of cell.<br/>
Protoplasm is divided into two parts.<br/>
<b>A.Cytoplasm:</b> The fluid found outside the nuclear membrane.<br/>
<b>B.Nucleoplasm:</b> The fluid found inside the nuclear membrane.<br/>
99% of protoplasm is made up of oxygen(76%), carbon(10.5%) hydrogen(10%) and nitrogen (2.5%).<br/>
80% of protoplasm is water.<br/>
The ratio of inorganic and organic compound found in protoplasm is 81:19<br/>
<b>Mitochondria:</b>Discovered by Altman in the year 1886. These are cylindrical, rod shaped or spherical structure found in cytoplasm. It is surrounded by double layered membrane. Inner membrane has many fold called cristae. The fluid presents inside mitochondria is called matrix, which contains many enzyme and co-enzyme.<br/>
Mitochondria is considered as prokaryotic cell inside eukaryotic.<br/>
<b>Function:</b> Mitochondria is the respiratory site of cellular respiration. Mitchondria synthesize energy rich compound ATP. It is also known as ‘Power House’ of the cell.<br/>
<b>Golgi bodies:</b> Discovered by scientist Camilo Golgi. Golgi bodies are made up of group of tubes, vesicles and vacuoles. In plant it is more in number and here it is known as dictyosomes.<br/>
<b>Function:</b> It work as storage, processing and packaging of material. It also involved ub the synthesis of cell wall, plasma membrane and lysosomes.<br/>
It help in the synthesis of carbohydrate from simple sugar which combine with protein made by ribosome forming glycoprotein.<br/>
<b>Endroplasmic reticulum:</b> Membraous network of tubules like structure found in cytoplasm is called endoplasmic reticulum. It is attached with the nucleus on one side and on other side it is joined with plasma membrane.<br/>
<b>Function:</b> Endoplasmic reticulum helps in the distribution of material. It forms supporting framework of cell.<br/>
<b>7.Ribosome:</b> Discovered by Palade. Small granules like structure found attached to the endoplasmic reticulum or in free state. It is made up of ribonucleic acid(RNA).<br/>
<b>Function:</b> Take part in protein synthesis.<br/>
<b>8.Lysosome:</b> Discovered by De Duve. These are sac like structure bonded by single membrane and contain hydrolytic enzyme.<br/>
<b>Function:</b> It helps in intralcellular digestion. The enzyme found in lysosome may digest the entrie cell. So it is also known as suicidal bag.<br/>
Lysosome is not found in Red blood corpuscles of mammal.<br/>
<b>Centrosome:</b>Discovered by Boveri. It is only found in animal cell taking part in cell division. It is not bounded by membrane consist of two centriole.<br/>
<b>Function:</b>Help in the formation of spindle fibre between pole during cell division.<br/>
<b>10Plastide:</b> Only found in plant cell. It is of three type: (a) Chloroplast (b) Chromoplast (c ) Leucoplast.<br/>

In human male sex chromosome is ‘XY’, where as in female sex chromosome is XX. During gamete formation in
male half of the sperm contain ‘X’ chromosome while other half contain ‘Y’ Chromosome.
In female all gametes contain only one type of chromosome that is ‘X’. Thus when a male gamete i.e.
sperm carrying ‘X’ chromosome fertilize an ova, the zygote develop into female. When a sperm carrying ‘y’
chromosome fertilizes an egg, zygote develops into male.

<![CDATA[
More and more creation of organism by gradual changes from low categories animal to higher animal is called organic evolution.  There are several evidence regarding organic evolution.<br/>
<b>•Homologous organ:</b> Organ which are seen different due to use in its function but internal structure and embryonic development are similar. Ex- Flipper of whale, feather of bat, forelimb of horse, Paw of cat, and hands of human.<br/>
<b>•Analogous organ:</b> Organ which looks similar due to be used in similar function but their internal structure and embryonic development are different. Ex- Feather of butterfly, bats and birds all looks similar but their internal structure and origin are different.
<b>•Vestigial organ:</b> These are organs which appear functionless in an organism but functional in their ancestor. For example vermiform appendix of large intestine functional in their ancestor. For example vermiform appendix of large intestine and nictitating membrane of human. Vermiform appendix is functional in herbivorous mammal even now.
<b>•Fossils –</b> Fossils are the remains of ancient plant or animal which provide evidences for evolution. Example – Archaeopteryx.
<b>•Archaeopteryx:</b> It is a fossils look like bird but bear a number of features found in reptiles. So, it is a connecting link between aves and reptile.
<b>Theories of evolution</b>
<b>1.Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778)</b> contribution to classification provide an evolutionary relationship among the organism. He was also supported an idea that no species ins new. Each and every species originates from some pre-existing species. He wrote  ‘species plantarum’ and proposed binomial system of nomenclature.
<b>Jean Baptist Lamarck(1744-1829)</b> tried to explain the evolutionary process in his book Philosophic zoologique. The theory proposed by Lamark is known as theory of inheritance of acquired characters. According to this theory use and disuse of an organ lead to acquiring change in the features of that organ. These changes are also inherited to offspring. The favourable changes after long period of time result in evolution of new specie. But Lamarckism was very strongly criticized by August Weismann.
<b>Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882)</b> explain th evolutionary principle in his book’The origin of species’. The theory proposed by him is popularly known as ‘Theory of natural selection’ or Darwinism. Darwin explained that despite having the enormous potential of fertility, the population of organism remains within a limit. It is due to struggle between members o same species and different species for food, space and mate. Struggle eliminates the unfit individual. The fit organism possess some variations which are favourable and they can leave the progeny to give rise to origin of new species with progress in genetics, the sources of variation were explained and Darwin’s theory was modified. Now the most excepted theory of evolution is Modern synthetic theory was modified. Now the most exceptedtheory of evolution is Modern synthetic theory, in which origin of species is based on the interaction of genetic variation and natural selection.
•Among Permian, Triassic, Cretaceous and Jurassic geological era cretaceous is the newest one.
•The book which contains information about plant is called red data book.
•Recapitulation theory was proposed by – Erunst Haeckel
•The basic unit of biosystematics is genotype.

<![CDATA[
<b>1.Cryptogamous plants</b><br/>
There are no flower and seed in these types of plants. These are classified into the following groups:<br/>
<b>Thalophyta:</b><br/>
⦁	This is the largest group of the plant kingdom.<br/>
⦁	The body of the plants in this group is thalus like i.e, plant are not differentiated into root, stem and leaves.<br/>
⦁	There is no conducting tissue. It is divided into two groups.<br/>
⦁	Algae and (b) Fungi<br/>
    <b>(a) Algae</b><br/>
⦁	The study of algae is called Phycology.<br/>
⦁	The algae normally have chlorophyll and autotrophic mode of nutrition.<br/>
⦁	Its body is thalus like. It may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous.<br/>
              <b>Useful Algae:</b><br/>
⦁	As a food: Porphyra, Ulva, Surgassum, Laeminaria, Nostoc etc.<br/>
⦁	In making Iodine: Laeminaria, Fucus, Echlnia etc.<br/>
⦁	As a manure: Notoc, Anabana, kelp etc.<br/>
⦁	In making medicines: Chloreloline from Chlorella and Tincher iodine is made from Laminaria.<br/>
⦁	In research works: Chlorella Acetabularia, Belonia etc.<br/>
    <b>(b) Fungi</b><br/>
⦁	Study of fungi is called Mycology.<br/>
⦁	Fungi is chlorophyll less central carrier tissue less, Thalophyta.<br/>
⦁	Accumulated food in fungi remains as Glycogen.<br/>
⦁	Its cell wall is made up of chitin. Ex. Albugo, Phytophthora Mucor etc.<br/>
Fungi may creates serious diseases in plants. Most damage is caused by rust and smut. Main Fungal disease in plants are as:<br/>
While rust of crucifer, Loose smut of wheat, Rust of wheat, early Blight of potato, Red rot of sugarcane, Tikka diseases of groundnut, Wart disease of potato, Brown leaf spot of rice, Late blight of potato, Damping off of seedlings etc.<br/>
⦁	Rhizopus is a fungi commonly known as ‘bread mould’<br/>
⦁	Heterothalllism in fungi was discovered by – A . F. Blakelee<br/>
⦁	Alfa-toxins are prouduced by fungi.<br/>
⦁	Lichens are the association of algae and fungi<br/>
⦁	Linchens developing on rocky substrates are called saxicolous.<br/>
        <b>Bryophyta</b><br/>
    This is the firt group of land plants. In this division approximately 25000 species are included.<br/>
⦁	In bryophyta there is lack of Xylem and phloem tissue.<br/>
⦁	Plant body may be of thallus like and leafy erect structure as in moss.<br/>
⦁	They lack true roots, Stem and leaves.<br/>
⦁	This community is also called Amphibian category of the plant kingdom.<br/>
⦁	Water conduction take place in mosses through parenchyma.<br/>
The moss namely Sphagnum is capable of soaking water 18 times of its own weight. Therefore, gardeners use it to protect from drying while taking the plants from one place to another.<br/>
⦁	The Sphagnum moss is used as fuel.<br/>
⦁	The Sphagnum moss is also used as antiseptic.<br/>
    <b>Pteridophyta</b><br/>
The plants of this group is mostly found in wet shady places, forests and mountains.<br/>
⦁	The body of plants is differentiated into root, stem , and leaves. Stem remains as normal rhizome.<br/>
⦁	Reproduction occurs by spores produced inside the sporangia.<br/>
Sporangia bearing leaf of a ferm is called ‘Sorus’<br/>
⦁	Gametophytic phase is short lived. The diploid zygote develops into an embryo.<br/>
⦁	Plants of this community have conducting tissues. But Xylem does not contain Vessels and Phloem does not contain companion cells.<br/>
  <b>2. Phanerogamous or Floral plant</b><br/>
Plants of this group is well developed. All the plants in this group bears flowers, fruits and seeds. Plants in this group can be classified into two sub-groups – Gymnosperm and Angiosperm.<br/>
    <b>(A)Gymnosperm</b><br/>
⦁	These plants are in the forms of trees and bushes. Plant body are differentiated into root, stem & leaves.<br/>
⦁	Plants are woody, perennial and tall. Plant bear naked seed.<br/>
⦁	Its tap roots are well developed.<br/>
⦁	Pollination takes place through air.<br/>
The longest plant of the Plant kingdom, Sequoia gigentia comes under in the height is 120 meters. This also called Red Wood of California.<br/>
⦁	The smallest plant is Zaimia Pygmai.<br/>
⦁	Living fossils are Cycas, Ginkgo biloba and Metasequia.<br/>
⦁	Ginkgo biloba is also called Maiden hair tree.<br/>
⦁	Ovule and Antherozoids of Cycas is the largest in Plant kingdom.<br/>
⦁	Corolloid roof of cycas help in absorption  of water and fixation of nitrogen.<br/>
⦁	The pollen grains of Pinus are so much in number that later it turns into Sulphur showers.<br/>

<b>Importance of Gymnosperm</b><br/>
⦁	As a food – Sago is made by extracting the juice from the stems of Cycas. Therefore, Cycas is called Sago-palm<br/>
⦁	Wood- The wood of Pine, Sequoia, Deodar, Spruce etc is used for making furniture.<br/>
⦁	Vapour oil – We get Tarpin oil from the trees of Pine, Cedrus oil from Deodar tree and Cedcast oil from Juniperous wood.<br/>
⦁	Tannin – It is useful in tanning and making ink.<br/>
⦁	Resin – Resin is extracted from some conical plants which are used in making varnish, polish, paint etc.<br/>
⦁	Resin is the product of coniferous tree.<br/>
⦁	Best example of polyembryony is citrus.<br/>
    <b>(B)Angiosperm</b><br/>
⦁	In the plants of this sub-group seeds are found inside the fruits.<br/>
⦁	In these plants root leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds are fully developed.<br/>
In the plants of this sub- group there is seed in seeds. On the basis of number of cotyledons plants are divided into two categories-<br/>
⦁	Monocotyledon and 2. Dicotyledon.<br/>

⦁	In nature, there are ultra microscopic particle known as viruses.<br/>
⦁	It has both the characters of living and non living, so it is a connecting link between living & non living.<br/>
⦁	Dr. Stanley first isolated the virus causing mosaic disease in tobacco in the form of crystals.<br/>
<b>Characters of virus</b><br/>
⦁	They became active inside a living cells.<br/>
⦁	Nucleic acid replicate themselves and they reproduce rapidly.<br/>
⦁	They cause disease like bacteria & fungi.<br/>
                According to parasitic nature, virus is of three types –<br/>
⦁	Plant virus – RNA is present as its nucleic acid.<br/>
⦁	Animal virus  - DNA or sometimes RNA is found in it.<br/>
⦁	Bacteriophage – They depend only on bacteria. They kill the bacteria. DNA is found in them. Example- T -2 phage.<br/>
⦁	In man virus cause disease like mumps, chicken pox, hepatitis, polio, AIDs and Herpes.<br/>
⦁	HIV often change its shape due to the presence of an enzyme reverse transcrptase.<br/>
⦁	The enzyme intergrase produced by virus allow the intergration of HIV-DNA into the host cell DNA.<br/>
⦁	EBOLA is a virus.<br/>
⦁	Bacteriophages: Bacteriophages are those virus which infect the bacteria.<br/>
Example – Toabacco mosaic virus.<br/>

<b>Bacteria</b><br/>
                            It was discovered by Antony Von Leeuwenhook of Holland in the year 1683.<br/>
⦁	Leeuwenhook is called the father of Bacteriology.<br/>
⦁	The year 1843-1892 – Robert Koch discovered the bacteria of Tuberculosis diseases.<br/>
⦁	The year 1812-1892 – Louis Pasteur discovered the vaccine of Rabies and pasteurization of milk.<br/>

<b>Morphology:</b> The study of forms and features of different parts of plants like roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits etc is called Morphology.<br/>
<b>Root</b><br/>
Root is the descending part of the plant which develops from radical.<br/>
Root generally grows in the soil away from light.<br/>
Roots are of two types-<br/>
Root hairs arises from epidermis.<br/>
1.Tap root and 2. Adventitious root.<br/>
Modification of Tap roots are:<br/>
Conical – like Carrot<br/>
 Napiform – like Turnip, beet etc.<br/>
Fusiform – like Radish.<br/>
Rootless plant is lemna.<br/>

<b>Stem</b><br/>
This is the part of a plant which grows towards light.<br/>
So, they are usually positively phototrophic.<br/>
It develops from plumule.<br/>
The modification of stems are as under –<br/>
<b>Underground stem</b><br/>
1.Tuber – like Potato.<br/>
2.Corm – like Ceolocasia, Saffron etc.<br/>
3.Bulb – like Onion, Garlic etc.<br/>
4.Rhizome – like Turmeric, Ginger etc.<br/>
      <b>Leaf</b><br/>
It is green. Its main function is synthesis of food through photosynthesis.<br/>
In cactus leaves are modified into spines.<br/>
Cactus is referred as xerophytes.<br/>
<b>Flower</b><br/>
This is the reproductive part of the plant.<br/>
In the flower Calyx, Corolla, Androecium and Gynoecium are found. Out of these androecium is male sex organ and the Gynoecium is female sex organ.<br/>
<b>Androecium:</b> Unit of androecium is stamen there is one or more stamens in the androecium. Pollen grains are found in anther.<br/>
<b>Gynoecium:</b> Unit of gynoecium is carpel. There are three parts of carpel –<br/>
1.Ovary, 2.Style and 3.Stigma.<br/>
<b>Pollination:</b>After maturation of Anther, the process of transfer of pollen grains to stigma is called pollination. Pollination is of two types –<br/>
1.Self – pollination 2.Cross – pollination<br/>
<b>Fertilization:</b> Pollen tube reaches the egg cell after entering into the ovule through a pore called micropyle. After that a male nucleus fuse with egg-cell.<br/>
This is called fertilization. Fertilized egg is called zygote.<br/>
In angiosperm, the fertilization is triple fusion where as in other category of plants it is double fusion.<br/>
<b>Parthenocarpy:</b> In some plants fruits are developed from ovary without fertilization. This type of fruit is called parthenocarpy. Normally these types of fruits are seedless. Example – Banana, Papaya, Orange, Grapes, Pine-apple etc.<br/>
Bulbil take part in vegetative reproduction.<br/>
The inflorescence of wheat is spike.<br/>
Photoperiodism affects the flowering of plant.<br/>
<b>Formation of fruits</b> <br/>
Fruit is a matured or ripened ovary developed after fertilization.<br/>
Formation of fruit takes place from ovary.<br/>
Fruits are divided into three types –<br/>
Simple fruits – like Banana, Guava etc.<br/>
Aggregate fruit – Strawberry, Custard apple etc.<br/>
Composite fruit – Jackfruit, Mulbery etc.<br/>
In the development of some fruits, Calyx, Corolla and thalamus takes part.<br/>
These types of fruits are called False fruits. Example – Apple,Jackfruit, pear etc.<br/>
Some fruits and their edible parts<br/>

<![CDATA[
⦁	<b>Meristematic tissue:</b> Growing regions of the plants are called Meristem. Meristematic tissue have capability of cell division. Daughter cells formed out. It grow and constitute the different parts of the plant. This process continues till the life-span of the plant.<br/>
Specific features of the Meristematic tissues are as follows –<br/>
⦁	It is round, oval or multisided.<br/>
⦁	Its wall is thin and cytoplasm is homogeneous.<br/>
⦁	Cell contains dense cytoplasm and a single large nucleus.<br/>
⦁	There is lack of inter-cellular spaces between the cells.<br/>
<b>Apical Meristems:</b> These tissues are found in the root and stem apex and the initial growth(specially length) of the plants take place due to these tissue.<br/>
<b>Lateral Meristems:</b> Due to the division in these tissue growth in the girth of roots and stems take place. Hence, it increases the width of the root and stem.<br/>
<b>Intercalary Meristems:</b> They are located at the base of internode. In fact, this is the remains of the Apical Meristems, which is divided by the incoming of permanent tissues in the centre. Plants increase its length by the activity of this. Its importance is for those plants whose apical parts are eaten by vegetarian animals. After being eaten the apex part the plants grow with the help of intercalary meristems only. Like – grass.<br/>
⦁	<b>Permanent tissue:</b> Permanent tissues are made of those mature tissues that have lost their capacity of division and attain a definite forms for various works. These cells can be alive or dead.<br/>
<b>Simple tissue:</b> If permanent tissue is made up of similar types of cells, it is called simple tissue.<br/>
<b>Complex tissue:</b> If permanent tissue is made up of similar types of cells, it is called Complex tissue.<br/>
<b>Xylem:</b> This is usually called wood. This is conducting tissue. Its two main functions are –<br/>
1.Conduction of water and minerals and <br/>
2.To provide mechanical consistency.<br/>
The determination of age of the plant is done by counting annual rings of the xylem tissue. The method of determining the age of plant is called Dendrochronology.<br/>
<b>Phloem:</b> This is a conducting tissue. Its main function is to conduct foods prepared by the leaves to different parts of the plant.<br/>
⦁	Companion cells of phloem are found in angiosperm.<br/>
⦁	Transpiration in plant is a process of water loss from its aerial part.<br/>
⦁	The cells which are closely associated and interacting with guard cells are subsidiary cells.<br/>

<p>In the presence of water, light, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide,
the formation of carbohydrates in plant is
called photosynthesis.
</p>
<p>Carbondioxide, water, chlorophyll and sunlight are necessary for photosynthesis.</p>

<ol >

  <li>Terrestrial plants takes CO<sup>2</sup> from atmosphere whereas aquatic plants use carbon dioxide disolve in water.</li>
  <li>Water enters into the cells of the leaves through osmosis and CO, through diffusion from atmosphere or release during respiration.</li>
  <li>Water necessary for photosynthesis is absorbed by the roots. Oxygen produced during photosynthesis is due to photolysis of water.</li>

</ol>

<ol>
<li>The green colour of the plants is due to the presence of chlorophyll.
Chlorophyll are photoreceptor molecule, which trap the solar energy.
There are different type of chlorophyll molecule like &apos;a&apos;,&apos;b&apos;,&apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos; & &apose;&apos;.
Chlorophyll &apos;a&apos; & &apos;b&apos;are most common and are found in plant.
</li>

<li>There is an atom of magnesium in the centre of chlorophyll.</li>
<li>Chlorophyll absorbs the violet, blue and red colours of light.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rate of photosynthesis is maximum in red light and is minimum in violet light.</p>
<p>⦁ The process of photosynthesis is a reaction of oxidation and reduction,
Oxidation of water takes place forming oxygen and reduction of carbon dioxide takes place forming glucose.
</p>
<p>The stages of process of photosynthesis</p>

    <p>1.Photochemical reaction or light reaction and<br/>
    2. Dark chemical reaction.</p>

<p>1. Photochemical reaction: This reaction is completed in the grana of the chlorophyll.
This is also called Hill reaction. In this process breaking down of water takes
 place releasing hydrogen ion and electron. For photolysis of water, energy is received from the light.
 At the end of this process, ATP is formed from ADP & P.
</p>


<p>2. Dark chemical reaction: This reaction takes place in the stroma of chlorophyll.
In this reaction reduction of carbon dioxide takes place and sugar or starch are formed.
It is also known as Calvin Benson cycle.</p>


<ol>

<li>Root pressure is measured by auxanometer.</li>
<li>The cell which are closely associated and interacting with guard cells are subsidiary cells.</li>
<li>Conversion of starch to sugar is essential for stomatal opening.</li>

<![CDATA[
<p>Following five hormones are found in plants - </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1. Auxins:</b> Auxins was discovered by Darwin in the year 1880. This is the hormone which controls the growth of plants.
Its formation takes place in the apical parts of the plants. Its main functions are -
</p>
<p>1. It prevents the separation of the leaves.<br/>
2. It destroys the straws.<br/>
3. It saves the crops from falling.<br/>

</p><b>2. Gibberellins :</b> It was discovered by a Japanese scientistKurosava in the year 1926. </p>
</p>The growth harmone gibberellins was first extracted from fungus in 1938 by Yabuta and Sumiki.</p>
</p>Functions:<br/>
1. It turns the dwarf plants into long plants. It helps in creating flowering.<br/>
2: It help in breaking the dormancy of plant.<br/>
3. It motivates the seeds to be sprout.<br/>
4. It increases the activity of cambium in the wooden plants.<br/>
5. Large sized fruits and flowers can be produced by its scattering.<br/>
</p>
</p><b>3. Cytokinins:</b> It was discovered by Miller in the year 1955 but it was named by Lethem. </p>
</p>Functions:<br/>
1. It naturally works in coordination with auxins.<br/>
2. It help in cell division and development in the presence of auxins.<br/>
3. It help in breaking the dormancy of seed.<br/>
4. It is helpful in making RNA and protein.
</p>
</p><b>4. Abscisic Acid or ABA:</b> This hormone was initially discovered by Carnes and
Adicote and later on by Waring.
</p>
</p>Functions:<br/>
1. This hormone is against to the growth.<br/>
2. It keeps the seeds & bud in dormant condition.<br/>
3. It plays main role in separation of leaves.<br/>
4. It delays in flowering of long day plant.

</p>
</p><b>5. Ethylene:</b> This is the only hormone found in gaseous form. In 1962 Burg proven it as harmone. </p>
<p>Functions:<br/>
1. It helps in the ripening the fruits.<br/>
2. It increases the number of female flowers.<br/>
3. It motivates the separation of leaves, flowers and fruits.<br/>
</p>
<p>Gas used for artificial ripening of fruit is ethane or ethylene.</p>
<p><b>Florigens:</b> It is formed in leaves but helps in blooming of the flowers.
Therefore, it is also called flowering hormones.
</p>
<p><b>Traumatin :</b> This is a type of dicarboxylic acid.
It is formed in injured cells by which the injury of plants is healed.<br/>
The concept of tissue culture was introduced by Haberlandt.

<p>The most important indoor air pollutant is Radon gas.</p>
<p>2. Water pollution: Mixing of unwanted substances with water is called water pollution.<br/>
Only 2.5 to 3% water present on the earth is usable.
</p>
<p><b>Sources of water pollution:</b> The water pollution takes place mainly due to mixing up of Carbonate,
sulphates of Magnesium and Potassium, Ammonia,</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide, Carbon dioxide and Industrial remains in water. Sea-water pollution is due to mixing up of heavy metals, hydro carbon, petroleum etc in water. </p>

<ol>
<li>Oil spill from the tanker spread soon on the surface of sea water. </li>

<li>Pollution of river water is measured by oxygen dissolve in it.</li>
<li>In some part of India Arsenic is found as pollutant in drinking water.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>3. Sound pollution:</b> The unwanted and undesirable sounds scattered in atmosphere are called sound pollution.<br/>
<b>Sources of sound pollution:</b> The source of sound pollution is loud sound or noise, in whatever ways it has produced.
</p>
<p><b>4. Soil pollution:</b> Distorted form of soil which change its chemical nature is called Soil pollution.<br/>
<b>Sources of Soil pollution:</b> acid rain, water from mines, excessive use of fertilizers and germicide chemicals, garbage, industrial remaining, excretion in field etc are the main sources of soil pollution.
</p>
<p><b>5. Nuclear pollution:</b> This pollution is created by radioactive rays. Following can be the sources of radioactive pollution -<br/>
(a) Pollution from the rays which are used in treatment.<br/>
(b) Pollution created from fuels used in Atomic reactors.<br/>
 c) Pollution created from the use of nuclear weapons.<br/>
(d) Pollution created remaining substances coming out of Atomic power-houses.
</p>

<ol>

Example: Adipose tissue found beneath the skin. Ligament made up of fibrous connective tissue. Cartilage, bone and blood.</b>
Note: Blood is only tissue which is found in the form of fluid.
</p>

<p><b>3. Muscular Tissue:</b> This is also known as contractile tissue. All the muscles of the body are made up of this tissue. Muscle tissue is of three types - (a) Unstriped, (b) Striped and c) Cardiac.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>(a) Unstriped :</b> This muscle tissue is found on the walls of those parts which do not controlled by will. These are called involuntary muscle, like - Alimentary canal, Rectum, Ureter, Blood vessels. Unstriped muscles control the motions of all those organs that move on their own.
</p>
<p><b>(b) Striped :</b> These muscles are found in the parts of the body that move voluntary. Normally one or both the end of these muscles turn and connect with
bones as tendon.
</p>
<p><b>c) Cardiac:</b> These muscles are found only on the walls of the heart. The contraction and expansion of the heart is due to these muscles that move throughout the life without fail.</p>


<ol>

<li>There are 639 muscles in the human body.</li>
<li>The largest muscle of the human body is Gluteus Maximus (muscle of the hip). </li>
<li>The smallest muscle of the human body is Stapedius.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>


</ol>
<p><b>4. Nervous Tissue:</b> This tissue is also called sensitive tissue. The nervous systems of the organisms is made up of these tissues. This is made up of two specific cells - (a) Nerve cell or Neurons and (b) Neuroglia.
Nervous tissue controls all the voluntary and involuntary activities of the body.

<p><b>Function of plasma :</b> Transportation of digested food, hormones, exeretory product etc from one part of the body to another part.<br/>
<b>Serum:</b> When Fibrinogen and protein is extracted out of plasma, the remaining plasma is called serum.
</p>
<p><b>(B) Blood corpuscles:</b> This is the remaining 40% part of the blood. This is divided into three parts<br/>
1. Red Blood Corpuscles (RBCs)<br/>
2. White Blood Corpuscles (WBCs) and 3. Blood Platelets.<br/>
1. Red Blood Corpuscles (RBC): Red Blood Corpuscles (RBC) of a mammal is biconcave.</p>

<ol>

<li>There is no nucleus in it. Exception - Camel and Lama</li>
<li>RBC is formed in Bone marrow.</li>
<li>(At the embroynic stage its formation takes place in liver).</li>
<li>Its life span is from 20 days to 120 days.</li>
<li>Its destruction takes place in liver and spleen. Therefore, liver is called grave of RBC.</li>
<li>It contains haemoglobin, in which haeme is iron
containing compound and due to this the colour of blood is red.</li>
<li>Globin is a proteinous compound. With haeme it is extremely capable
of combining with oxygen and carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>The iron compound found in haemoglobin, as haematin.</li>
<li>The main function of RBC is to carry oxygen from the lung to all cells of the body and bring back the carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>Anaemia disease is caused due the deficiency of haemoglobin.</li>
<li>At the time of sleeping RBC reduced by 5% and people who are at the height of 4200 meters RBC increases by 30% in them.</li>
<li>Number of RBC is measured by an instrument called hemocytometer.</li>


</ol>
<p><b>2. White Blood Corpuscles (WBC) or Leucocytes:</b> In shape is similar to Amoeba.</p>
<ol>

<li>Its formation takes place in Bone marrow, lymph node and sometimes in liver and spleen.</li>
<li>Its life span is from 2 to 4 days.</li>
<li>Nucleus is present in the White Blood Corpuscles.</li>
<li>Its main function is to protect the body from the disease.</li>
<li>The ratio of RBC and WBC is 600: 1.</li>
<li>About 60 to 70% part of WBC is made up of neutrophile corpuscles which help in engulfing disease causing microorganism and bacteria.</li>

<p><b>Functions of blood:</b></p><br/>
<p>1. To control the temperature of the body and to protect the body from diseases. <br/>
2. Clotting of blood.<br/>
3.Transportation of O, CO,, digested food, conduction of hormones etc.<br/>
4. To help in establishing coordination among different parts.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>Clotting of Blood:</b> Three important reactions during clotting of blood.<br/>
1. Thromboplastin + Prothrombin + Calcium = Thrombin.<br/>
2. Thrombin + Fibrinogen = Fibrin.<br/>
3. Fibrin + Blood Corpuscles = Clot.<br/>
The formation of Prothrombin and Fibrinogen of the blood plasma takes place with the help of Vitamin K. Vitamin K is helpful in making clots of blood. Normally clotting takes the time from 2 to 5 minutes.<br/>
The compulsory protein in making clots of blood is Fibrinogen.

</p>
<p><b>Blood Group of human:</b> Blood Group was discovered by Landsteiner in 1900. For this, he was awarded with Nobel Prize in the year 1930.<br/>
The main reason behind the difference in blood of human is the glyco protein which is found in Red Blood Corpuscles called antigen.<br/>
Antigen are of two types - Antigen A and Antigen B.<br/>
On the basis of presence of Antigen or Glyco Protein, there are four group of blood in human :<br/>
(a) That contains Antigen A - Blood Group A.<br/>
(b) That contains Antigen B - Blood Group B.<br/>
 c) That contains both the Antigens A and B - Blood Group AB.<br/>
(d) That contains neither of the Antigens - Blood Group O.<br/>
An opposite type of protein, is found in blood plasma. This is called antibody. This is also of two types - Antibody &apos;a&apos; and Antibody &apos;b&apos;.
Therefore, with the four groups of blood division of antibody is as under-

<p><b>Blood Transfusion:</b> Antigen &apos;A&apos; and antibody &apos;a&apos;, Antigen &apos;B&apos; and antibody &apos;b&apos; cannot live together.
In case of so happened these get most sticky, which spoils the blood. This is called agglutination of blood.
Therefore, in blood transfusion adjustment of Antigen and
Antibody should be done carefully so that agglutination of blood do not takes place.</p>

<ol>

<li>Blood Group O is called Universal Donor because it does not contain any antigen.</li>
<li>Blood Group AB is called Universal Receptor because it does not contain any antibody.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Rh factor:</b> In the year 1940, Landsteiner and Wiener discovered a different type of antigen in the blood.
They discovered it in the Rhesus monkey, therefore, it is called Rh-factor.
In the blood of that person it is found, their blood is called Rh-positive and in the blood of that person it is not found, is called Rh-negative.
At the time of blood transfusion Rh-factor is also tested. Rh+ is given to Rh+ and Rh is given Rh-blood only.
If the blood of Rh+ blood group is transferred to a person with Rh-blood group,
then due to the less quantity for the first time there does not seem any bad effect but if this process is repeated then due to agglutination the person with Rh-blood group dies.

<![CDATA[
<p><b>(a) Digestive System</b><br/>
The complete process of nutritioin is divided into five stages:<br/>
1. Ingestion  2.Digestion 3.Absorption<br/>
4.Assimilation 5.Defecation<br/>
<b>1. Ingestion :</b> Taking the food into the mouth is called Ingestion.<br/>
<b>2. Digestion:</b> Conversion of nonabsorbable food into absorbable form. The digestion of the food is started from the mouth.
</p>


<ol>
<li> Saliva is secreted by salivary gland in mouth in which enzyme amylase is present. They convert starch into simple sugar and make it digestible.</li>
<li> In human secretion of saliva is approximately 1.5 litre per day.</li>
<li> The nature of saliva is acidic (pH 6.8).</li>
<li> From the mouth food reach into stomach through food pipe. No digestion takes place in food pipe.</li>
<li> The teeth used for grinding of food is molar.</li>
</ol>
<b>Digestion in Stomach</b>

<ol>
<li> The foods lies approximately for four hours in stomach.</li>
<li> After reaching the food in stomach gastric glands secretes the gastric juice.
This is a light yellow acidic liquid.</li>
<li> Hydrochloric acid secreted from the Oxyntic cells of the stomach kills
all the bacteria coming with food and accelerates the reaction of enzymes.
Hydrochloric acid makes the food acidic by which amylase reaction of the saliva end.
The enzymes in the gastric juice of stomach are - Pepsin and Renin.
</li>
<li> Pepsin breaks down the protein into peptones.</li>
<li> Renin breaks down the Caseinogen into Casein found in milk.</li>
</ol>
<b>Digestion in Duodenum</b>
<ol>
<li> As soon as the food reaches the duodenum bile juice from liver combines with it.
Bile juice is an alkaline and it turns the acidic medium of food into alkaline. </li>
<li> Here, pancreatic juice from pancreas combines with food. It contains three types of enzymes :</li>

</ol>

<b>(a) Trypsin:</b> It converts the protein and peptone into polypeptides and amino
<b>(b) Amylase:</b> It converts the starch into soluble sugar.
<b> c) Lipase:</b> It converts the emulsified fats into glycerol and fatty acids.

<b>Small Intestine</b>

<ol>
<li> Here, the process of digestion completed and absorption of digested foods start.</li>
<li> From the wall of small intestine, intestinal juices secretes. The following enzymes contain :</li>

</ol>
<p><b>(a) Erepsin:</b> It converts the remaining protein and peptone into amino acids.<br/>
<b>(b) Maltase:</b> It converts the maltose into glucose.<br/>
<b> c) Sucrase:</b> It converts the sucrose into glucose and fructose.<br/>
<b>(d) Lactase:</b> It converts the lactose into glucose and galactose.<br/>
<b>(e) Lipase:</b> It converts the emulsified fats into glycerol and fatty acids.<br/>
Intestinal juice is alkaline in nature.<br/>
In a healthy people approximately 2 litres of intestinal juice secretes every day.<br/>
<b>3. Absorption :</b> Digested food get mixed into blood is called absorption. The absorption of digested foods takes place through villi found in the wall of small intestinal.<br/>
<b>4. Assimilation :</b> Use of absorbed food in the body is called assimilation.<br/>
<b>5. Defecation :</b> Undigested food reaches into large intestine where bacteria turns it into faeces, which is excreted through anus.<br/>

<![CDATA[
<b>The main organs participating in digestion:</b>
<p><b>Liver:</b> This is the largest gland of the human body. Its weight is approximately 1.5-2 kilogram.</p>
<ol>
<li> Bile is secreted through liver only. This bile accelerate the reaction of enzymes present in the intestine.</li>
<li> Liver convert excess of amino acid into ammonia by deamination. These ammonia are further converted into urea by ornithine cycle. Urea comes out from body through kidney.</li>
<li> Liver converts some quantity of protein into glucose during deficiency of carbohydrate.</li>
<li> In carbohydrates metabolism liver converts the excess of glucose found in blood into glycogen and stores it into hepatic Cell as reserve nutrients. If the necessity of glucose arises the liver convert reserve glycogen into glucose. Thus, it regulates the quantity of glucose in the blood.</li>
<li> In case of decrease of fat in food liver converts some of the parts of the carbohydrates into fat.</li>
<li> The production of fibrinogen protein takes place by liver which helps in clotting of blood.</li>
<li> The production of Heparin protein takes place in liver which prohibit the clotting of blood inside the body.</li>
<li> The dead RBC is destroyed by the liver only.</li>
<li> The liver reserve some quantity of iron, copper and vitamin.</li>
<li> It helps in regulating the body temperature.</li>
<li> Liver is an important clue in investigating a person&apos;s death that has been due to poison in food.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Gall Bladder:</b> Gall bladder is a pear shaped sac, in which the bile coming out of liver is stored.</p>
<ol>
<li> Bile comes into the duodenum from gall bladder through the bile duct. </li>
<li> Secretion of bile into the duodenum takes place by reflex action. </li>
<li> Bile is a yellowish-green coloured alkaline liquid. Its pH value is 7.7. </li>
<li> The quantity of water is 85% and the quantity of bile pigment is 12%. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Main functions of bile are as under:<br/>
1. It makes the medium of food alkaline so that pancreatic juice can worked.<br/>
2. It kills the harmful bacteria coming with food.<br/>
3. It emulsifies the fats.<br/>
4. It accelerates the bowel movement of intestine by which digestive juices in the food mix well.<br/>
5. It is helpful in the absorption of vitamin K and other vitamins mixed in fats.<br/>
In case of obstruction in bile duct, liver cells stop taking bilirubin from blood. As a result, bilirubin spreads throughout the body. This is called jaundice.<br/>

</p>
<p><b>Pancreas:</b> This is the second largest gland of the human body. It acts as simultaneously endocrine and exocrine type of gland.<br/>
Pancreatic juice secretes out of it in which 9.8% water and the remaining parts contain salt and enzymes. It is alkaline liquid, whose pH value is 7.5-8.3. It contains the enzymes which can digest all the three types of food materials (like carbohydrates, fat and protein), therefore it is called complete digestive juice.
</p>
<p><b>Islets of Langerhans:</b> This is a part of the Pancreas.<br/>
It was discovered by the medical scientist Langerhans.<br/>
From its ß cell-insulin, from a cell-glucagons and from 8 cell- somatostaintin hormones are secreted:<br/>
</p>
<p><b>Insulin :</b> It is secreted by B-cell of islets of Langerhans.</p>
<ol>
<li>  Glucagon is secreted by a-cell and somatostatin harmone is secreted by y-cell of islets of langerhans.</li>
<li>  It was discovered by Banting and Best in the year 1921.</li>
<li>  It controls the process of making glycogen from glucose. Diabetes is caused due to the deficiency of insulin.</li>
<li>  Excessive flow of insulin causes Hypoglycemia in which one loses the reproducing capacity and vision deterioration.</li>

</ol>
<p><b>Glucagon:</b> It re-converts the glycogen into glucose.
Somatostatin: This is a polypeptide hormone which increases the duration of assimilation of food.<br/>
Malfunctioning of pancreas cause diabetes.
</p>
<p><b>(b) Circulatory System</b><br/>
The discovery of blood circulation was done by William Harvey in the year 1628.
</p>
<p>There are four parts under it -<br/>
(a) Heart (b) Arteries  c) Veins (d) Blood.
</p>
<p><b>Heart:</b> It remains safe in the pericardial membrane. Its weight is approximately 300 grams.<br/>
Heart of the human is made up of four chambers. In the anterior side there is a right auricle and a left auricle.
In the posterior side of the heart there is a right ventricle and a left ventricle persist.

</p>
<ol>

<li> Between the right auricle and the right ventricle there is a tricuspid valve. </li>
<li> Between the left auricle and left ventricle there is a bicuspid valve.</li>
<li> The blood vessels carrying the blood from the body towards the heart is called vein.</li>
<li> In the vein there is impure blood i.e. carbon dioxide mixed blood.
Its exception is pulmonary vein, which always carry pure blood.</li>
<li> Pulmonary vein carries the blood from lungs to left auricle. It has pure blood.</li>
<li> The blood vessels carrying the blood from the heart towards the body is called artery.</li>
<li> In artery there is pure blood i.e. oxygen mixed blood. Its exception is pulmonary artery.</li>
<li> Pulmonary artery carries the blood from right ventricle to lungs. It contains impure blood.</li>
<li> In the right part of the heart, there remains impure blood i.e. carbon dioxide mixed blood and in the left part of
the heart there remains pure blood i.e. oxygen mixed blood.</li>
<li> The artery carrying blood to the muscles of the heart are called coronary arteries.
Any type of hindrance in it causes heart attack.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Course of circulation:</b> Mammals have double circulation. It mean blood have to cross two times from heart before circulating throughout the body.</p>
<p>Right auricle receive impure blood from the body which goes into right ventricle.
From here the blood went into pulmonary artery which send it to the lung for purification.
After purification it is collected by pulmonary vein which bring it back to heart in left auricle.
From auricle it went into left ventricle. Now this purified blood is went into aorta for different organ of body.<br/>
This circulation is done is a cardiac cycle.
</p>
<p><b>Cardiac cycle :</b> Rhythmic systole (Contraction) and diastole (relaxation) of auricle and ventricle constitutes a cardiac cycle.
</p>
<p><b>Heart beat :</b> Heart keeps beating rhythmically throughout the life. There is a node from which originate contraction of heart.
</p>
<p><b>1. Sino auricular node (SA node):</b> It is a specialised area of cardiac muscle fibre in right auricle. SA node is also known as pacemaker as it generates each wave of cardiac impulse.<br/>
<b>2. Auriculo Ventricular node (AV node):</b> AV node is present close to the interatrial septum near the right AV aperture. Wave of contraction is picked up by AV node which spread through.<br/>
Wave of excitation is picked up by AV node which spread through AV bundle of muscles fibres present on inter artrial septum as well as inter-ventricular septum.
</p>
<p>Artificial pacemaker: When SA node becomes defective or damaged, the cardiac impulses do not generate.
This can be cured by surgical grafting of an artificial pacemaker an electric device in the chest of the patient.
 It stimulate the heart electrically at regular intervals.<br/>

 The blood pressure of a normal human is 120/80. (Systolic - 120 and Diastolic -80).<br/>

</p>
 <ol>
 <li> Systole and diastole of the heart are collectively called heart beat.
 In the normal condition the heart of the human beats 72 times and in a single beat it pumps
 approximately 70 ml blood.<li/>

 <li> The blood pressure of a normal human is 120/80. (Systolic - 120 and Diastolic -80).</li>
 <li> Blood pressure is measured by sphygmomanometer.</li>
 <li> Thyroxin and adrenaline are the hormones which independently controls the heart beat.</li>
 <li> The CO, present in the blood accelerates the heart beat by reducing the pH. </li>
</ol>


<p><b>c) Lymph Circulatory System</b></p>
<ol>


 <li> The light yellow fluid found in the inter-cellular intervals between different tissues and cells is called lymph.</li>
 <li> Lymph is a fluid whose composition is like blood plasma, in which nutrient, oxygen and various other substances are present.</li>
 <li> The corpuscles found in lymph are called lymphocytes. In fact, these are White Blood Corpuscles (WBC).</li>
 <li> Lymph flows only in one direction from tissue towards heart.</li>
 <li> </li>
</ol>

<b>Functions of lymph:</b>

<p>1. The lymphocytes present in lymph helps to prevents the body from diseases by killing the harmful bacteria or other substances.<br/>
2. Lymph form the lymphocytes.<br/>
3. The node found in lymph vessels are called lymph node works as a filter in the human body.<br/>
4. Lymph helps in healing the wounds.<br/>
5. Lymph circulates different material from tissues to veins.
</p>

<b>(d) Excretory System</b>
<p><b>Excretion:</b> Removal of nitrogenous substances formed during metabolism from the body of human is called excretion. Normally excretion means the release of nitrogenous excretory substances like urea, ammonia, uric acid etc.<br/>
The main excretory organs of human are as follows-<br/>
1. Kidneys, 2. Skin, 3. Liver and 4. Lungs.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>1. Kidneys:</b> The main excretory organ in human and other mammals is a pair of kidneys.
Its weight is 140 grams. There are two parts of it. Outer part is called cortex and the
inner part is called medulla. Each kidney is made up of approximately 1,30,00000 kidney
ducts which are called nephrons. Nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney.
There is a cup like structure in the every nephron called Bowman&apos;s capsule. Glomerulus is made up
of thin blood vessels found in the Bowman&apos;s capsule which is made up of two types of arterioles.
</p>
<p><b>(a) Afferent arteriole :</b> Which carries the blood to the glomerulus.<br/>
<b>(b) Efferent arteriole : </b>By which the blood is taken out of the glomerulus. <br/>
</p>
<ol>
<li> The process of filtration of liquids into the cavity of Bowman&apos;s capsule, is called ultra filtration.</li>
 <li> The main function of the kidneys is purification of blood plasma i.e. to excrete the unwanted nitrogenous waste substances through urination.</li>
 <li> The supply of blood to kidneys takes place in large quantity in comparison to other organs.</li>
 <li> In the kidneys average 125 ml per minute blood is filtrated i.e. 180 litres per day. Out of it 1.45 litres urine is formed daily and the remaining is absorbed back by the cells of nephron and mix into the blood.</li>
 <li> In the normal urine there is 95% water, 2% salt, 2.7% urea and 0.3% uric acid.</li>
 <li> The colour of the urine is light yellow due to the presence of urochromes in it.</li>
 <li> Urochrome is formed by the dissociation of haemoglobin.</li>
 <li> Urine is acidic. Its pH value is 6.</li>
 <li> The stone formed in the kidneys is made up of calcium oxalate.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>2. Skin:</b> Oil gland and sweat glands found in the skin respectively secretes
sebum and sweat.<br/>
<b>3. Liver :</b> Liver cells play the main role in excretion by converting more and more amino acids and ammonia of blood into urea.<br/>
<b>4. Lungs:</b> The lungs excretes two types of gaseous substances carbon dioxide and water vapour. The excretion of some substances like garlic, onion and some spices in which vapour component is present excreted by the lungs.<br/>

<b>(ii) The function of thalamus :</b> It is the centre of the pain, cold and heat.<br/>
<b>(iii) The function of hypothalamus :</b> It controls the hormonal secretion of endocrine glands. Hormones secreted from posterior pituitary gland secrete through it. This is the centre of hunger, thirst, temperature control, love, hate etc. Blood pressure, metabolism of water, sweat, anger, joy etc are controlled by it.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>(2) Mid brain</b><br/>
The function of Corpora quadrigemina: This is the centre of control on vision and hearing power.
 </p>
<p><b>(3) Hind Brain</b><br/>
<b>(i) Function of cerebellum:</b> It is some what at the back of head and consist of two cerebellar hemisphere like cerebrum. It is large reflex centre for coordination of muscular body movements and maintenance of posture.<br/>
<b>(ii) Pons:</b> It act as bridge carrying ascending and descending tracts between brain and spinal cord.<br/>
(iii) Medulla: It is posterior most part of brain and continuous into the spinal cord. It connect and communicate the brain with spinal cord. It contains the cardiac respiratory and vasomotor centres that control complex activity like heart action, respiration, coughing, sneezing etc.<br/>
The brain of the human is situated in the cranium which protects it from external injury. Brain is covered by membrane called meanings.<br/>
Note: EEG (Electro encephlo graph) is done to known the function of brain.
 </p>
<p> <b>Spinal cord :</b> The posterior region of the medulla oblongata forms the spinal cord. Its main functions are:<br/>
(a) Coordination and control of reflex actions i.e. it works as the centre of the reflex actions.<br/>
(b) It carries the impulses coming out of brain.<br/>
Note: Reflex action was first discovered by the scientist, Marshall Hall.<br/>
<b>2. Peripheral Nervous System :</b> Peripheral Nervous System is made up of the nerves arising from brain and spinal cord. These are called cranial and spinal nerves respectively. There are sensory, motor and mixed nerve.
</p>
<p> There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 31 pairs of spinal nerve found in a human.<br/>
The unit of nervous tissues is called Neuron or nerve cell.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>3. Autonomic Nervous System:</b> Autonomic Nervous System is made up of some brain nerves
and some spinal cord nerves. It supplies nerves to all the internal organs and blood vessel of the body.
Langley, first presented the concept of Autonomic Nervous System in the year 1921.
There are two parts of Autonomic Nervous System:<br/>
(a) Sympathetic Nervous System<br/>
(b) Parasympathetic Nervous System. <br/>
 </p>

 <p><b>Functions of Sympathetic Nervous System</b><br/>
1. It narrows the blood vessels in the skin.<br/>
2. By its action hair gets erected.<br/>
3. It reduces the secretion of salivary glands.<br/>
4.It increases the heart beat.<br/>
5. It increase the secretion of sweat glands. <br/>
6. It stretches the pupil of eye ball.<br/>
7. It relax the muscles of urinary bladder.<br/>
8. It reduces the speed of contraction & relaxation of intestine.<br/>
9. The rate of respiration increase.<br/>
10. It increases the blood pressure.<br/>
11. It increases the sugar level in the blood.<br/>
12.It increases the number of Red Blood Corpuscles in the blood.<br/>
13. It helps in clotting of blood.<br/>
14. Collective impact of this affects fear, pain and anger.<br/>

</p>
 <p><b>Functions of Parasympathetic Nervous System:</b><br/>
The functions of this system is normally the opposite of Sympathetic Nervous System. For example:<br/>
1.It widens the lumen of blood vessels except the coronary blood vessels.<br/>
2.It increases the secretion of saliva and other digestive juices.<br/>
3. The contraction of pupil is caused by this.<br/>
4.It creates contraction in the other muscles of the urinary bladder.<br/>
5.It creates contraction and motion in intestinal walls.<br/>
6.The effect of this nervous system collectively creates the occasion of rest and joy.<br/>

(a) Axial skeleton: The skeleton, which makes the main axis of the body is called axial skeleton. Skull, vertebral column and bones of chest comes under it. There are 80 bones in axial skeleton.<br/>
</p>
 <p>(i) Skull: There are 29 bones in it. Out of these, 8 bones jointly protect the brain of the human.
 The structure made up of these bones is called forehead. All the bones of the forehead remain joined
 strongly by the sutures. There are 14 bones in addition to this which form the face.
 Six ear ossicles and one hyoid bone.</p>
 <p>(ii) Vertebral Column: The vertebral column of the human is made up of 33 vertebra.
 All the vertebra are joined by intervertebral disc. Vertebra is made flexible by these intervertebral disc.
 We divide the whole vertebral column into the following parts-<br/>

 Its first vertebra which is called atlas holds the skull.<br/>

 Functions of vertebral column:<br/>
1. Holds the head.<br/>
2. It provides the base to the neck and body.<br/>
3. It helps the human in standing, walking etc.<br/>
4. It provides flexibility to the neck and body by which a human can move its neck and body in any direction.<br/>
5. It provides protection to spinal cord.<br/>
(b) Appendicular skeleton: The following are the parts of it -<br/>
(i) Foot bones- Both hands and feet have 118 bones.<br/>
(ii) To hold the forelimb and hind limb on the axial skeleton in human there are two girdles.<br/>
The girdle of forelimb is called pectoral girdle and girdle of hindlimb is called pelvic girdle.<br/>
Pectoral girdle joined with forelimb is called humerus and the bone from pelvic girdle join to hindlimb is called femur.<br/>

Functions of the skeletal system:<br/>
1. To provide a definite shape to the body.<br/>
2. To provide protection to soft parts of the body.<br/>
3. To provide a base to the muscles for joining.<br/>
4. To help in respiration and nutrition.<br/>
5. To form Red Blood Corpuscles.<br/>

External ear of man is mainly made up of Cartilage. <br/>
Note: 1. The muscles and bones are join together by tendon.<br/>
2. The muscle which join bone to bone is called ligaments.
Ligaments of human body are made up of yellow fibre.<br/>

<b>(g) Endocrine System</b><br/>
(a) Exocrine glands: Gland which have duct are called exocrine gland. Secretion of enzymes pass through it. Example - Digestive gland, Sweat gland, Mucous gland, Salivary gland etc.<br/>
(b) Endocrine gland: These are ductless gland. Hormones are secreted by these gland. Hormones are sent to the different parts of the body through blood plasma. Example - Pituitary gland, Thyroid gland, Parathyroid gland etc.<br/>
Functions and effect of the main endocrine system of the human body and hormone secreted by them -<br/>

<b>1. Pituitary gland:</b> It is situated in a depression of the sphenoid bone of the fore head. This is called sella- tunica.<br/>
Its weight is approximately 0.6 grams.<br/>
This is also known as mastergland. Pitutary gland is controlled by hypothalmus. <br/>
The functions of the hormones secreted by Pituitary gland:<br/>
1. STH Hormone (Somatotropic hormone): It controls the growth of the body especially the growth of bones. By the excessiveness of STH gigantism and acromegaly are caused, in which height of the human grows abnormally. Lack of STH causes dwarfism in human,<br/>
2. TSH Hormone (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone): It stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete hormone.<br/>
3. ACTH Hormone (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone) It controls the secretion of adrenal cortex.<br/>
4. GTH Hormone (Growth Hormone): It controls the functions of gonads. This is of two types:<br/>
(a) FSH Hormone (Follicle - Stimulating Hormone): In male it stimulates spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. In female, it stimulates the Graffian follicles of the ovary to secret the hormone Oestrogen.<br/>
(b) LH Hormone (Luteiniging Hormone) Interstitial cell stimulating hormone-, secretion of testosterone hormone takes place in male and in case of female estrogen hormone secreted.<br/>

<b>5. LTH Hormone (Lactogenic Hormone):</b> Its main function is to stimulate secretion of milk in breasts for infants.<br/>
<b>6 ADH Hormone (Antidiuretic Hormone):</b> It causes increase in blood pressure. It is helpful in maintaining the water balance in the body and reduce the volume of urine.<br/>
Hypothalamus is the part of brain which control emotional reaction in our body.<br/>
 <b>2. Thyroid gland:</b> This is situated below the larynx on both side of respiratory trachea in throat of human.<br/>
The hormones secreted by it are Thyroxine and Triiodothyronine.<br/>
<b>Functions of Thyroxin :</b><br/>
1. It increases the speed of cellular respiration.<br/>
2. It is necessary for the normal growth of the body particularly for the development of bones, hair etc.<br/>
3.The normal functions of reproductive organs depend on the activeness of thyroid gland.<br/>
4.It controls the water balance of the body in coordination with the hormones of pituitary gland.<br/>

<b>Diseases Caused by the Deficiency of Thyroxin:</b><br/>
<b>1. Cretinism:</b> This disease affects the children. The mental and physical retardness of the child.<br/>
<b>2. Myxedema :</b> In this disease which normally attack during youth the metabolism does not take place properly which causes reduction in heart beat and blood pressure.<br/>
<b>3. Hypothyroidism:</b> This disease is caused due to a chronic deficiency of thyroxin hormone. Due to this diseases the normal reproduction is not possible. Sometimes due to its deficiency, human becomes dumb and deaf.<br/>
<b>4. Goitre:</b> This disease is caused by the deficiency of iodine in food. In this disease the shape of the thyroid gland enlarges abnormally.<br/>

<b>Diseases caused by the Excessiveness of Thyroxin :</b><br/>
Exothalmic Goitre : In this disease eyes get bulging out of the eye socket with increased metabolic rate.<br/>
3. Parathyroid gland: This is situated in the right back of the thyroid gland of the throat. Two hormones are secreted by it:<br/>
(a) Parathyroid hormone: This hormone is secreted when there is a deficiency of calcium in the blood.<br/>
(b) Calcitonin: This hormone is released when there is excess of calcium in the blood is present.<br/>
Hence, hormone secreted by parathyroid gland controls the quantity of calcium
in blood.<br/>
<b>4. Adrenal gland:</b> There are two parts of this gland - (a) outer part is cortex and (b) inner part is medulla.<br/>
Hormones secreted by cortex and their function:<br/>
(i) Glucocorticoids: This controls the metabolism of carbohydrate, protein and fat.<br/>
(ii) Mineralocorticoids: Its main function is reabsorption of ion by kidney ducts and to control the quantity of other on in the body.<br/>
(i) Sex Hormone It controls the sexual behaviour and secondary sexual characters.<br/>
Note: 1. Cortex is essential for life. If this is extracted completely from the body, human will remain alive only for a week or two.<br/>
2. In case of deformation of cortex, the process of metabolism gets disturbed; this disease is called Addison&apos;s disease.<br/>
Hormones secreted by Medulla and their function : <br/>
(a) Epinephrine- This is an amino acid.<br/>
(b) Nor epinephrine - This is also an amino acid.<br/>
The work of both the hormones is similar. These equally increase the relaxation and contraction of heart muscles. As a result, blood pressure increases and decreases.<br/>
In case of sudden stop of heart beat, epinephrine is helpful in re-starting the heart beat.<br/>
The hormone secreted by Adrenal gland is called fight flight, fright fight hormone.<br/>
Thymus is endocrine gland found situated in chest cavity.<br/>

<b>5. Gonads :</b><br/>
(1) Ovary: The following hormones are secreted by this:<br/>
(a) Estrogen: It completes the development of reproductive organs.<br/>
(b) Progesterone : It stimulates the thickening of uterus lining during ovarien cycle.<br/>
(c) Relaxin : During pregnancy it is found in uterus and placenta. This hormone smoothens the pubic symphysis and it widens the uterine cervix so that a child is delivered easily.<br/>
(2) Testes: The hormone secreted by it is called testosterone. It motivates the sexual behaviour and growth of secondary sexual characters.<br/>
Oxytocin is an example of harmone used to cause contraction of uterus. <br/>

<b>(h) Respiratory System</b><br/>
The most important organ of the respiratory system of human is lungs where the exchange of gases takes place.<br/>
All those organs comes under respiratory system which help in exchange  of gases are - Nasal passage, Pharynx, Larynx or Voice box, Trachea, Bronchi, Bronchioles, Lungs etc.<br/>

Nasal passage: Its main function is related to sniffing. Its inner cavity is lined with mucous membrane.
This secretes approximately 1⁄2 litre of mucous everyday. This prevents the particles of dust, bacteria
or other small organisms from entering into the body. It makes the air wet entering into the body and
equalises it with the temperature of the body.<br/>
Pharynx : It is situated behind the nasal cavity a common passage for both respiratory and digestive system.<br/>
Larynx : Pharynx open into anterior wider part of trachea called larynx. The opening is called glottis.
A cartilaginous flop like structure cover the glottis called epiglottis which prevent the entry of food
during swallowing. A pair of vocal cord is present inside the larynx help in producing sound.<br/>
</p>

 <p><b>Trachea:</b> From the base of larynx a tube is arises, passes through the neck and reaches upto
 middle of thorax is called trachea. It is supported by &apos;C&apos; shaped cartilaginous ring.
 Internally trachea is lined by ciliated and mucus secreting epithelium.
</p>
 <p><b>Bronchi:</b> In the thorocic region trachea divides into two branches called bronchi.
 Each bronchus enters into the lung of its own side. After entering into the lung bronchous
 of each side divide and redevide into very fine tube called bronchioles. Finally bronchioles
 give rise alveoli or alveolar sac. Alveoli are the site of gaseous exchange.
</p>
 <p><b>Lungs:</b> There is a pair of lungs in the thoracic cavity. Its colour is pink, red and looks like sponge.
 Right lung is larger in comparison to left lung. Each lung is surrounded by a membrane which
 is called pleural membrane. There is a network of blood capillaries. Here Oxygen enters into the blood
 and CO, release out from blood.<br/>

 The process of respiration can be divided into four parts:<br/>
1. External respiration. 2.Transportation of gases.<br/>
3. Internal respiration. 4.Cellular respiration.<br/>
External respiration: This is divided into two parts -<br/>
(a) Breathing (b) Exchange of gases.<br/>
(a) Breathing: In lungs air is taken and given out at a certain rate which is called breathing.<br/>
<b>Mechanism of Breathing:</b><br/>
<b>(i) Inspiration: </b>At this stage, air from the environment enters into the lungs through the nasal passage,
due to increases in the dimension of thoracic cavity a low pressure is formed in the lungs and air enters
into the lungs from environment. This air continues to enter until the pressure of air inside and outside
the body became equal.<br/>
<b>(ii) Expiration: </b>In this process air comes out of the lungs.

    <string name="bio38" formatted="false">


<![CDATA[
<p>Everyday approximately 400 ml water is excreted out through breathing.</p>
 <p><b>(b) Exchange of gases:</b> The exchange of gases takes place inside the lungs.
 This gaseous exchange takes place on the basis of concentration gradient through normal diffusion.
The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases takes place due to their difference in partial pressures.
The direction of diffusion is both side.


</p>
 <p><b>2. Transportation of gases:</b> The process of reaching of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) from lungs to
 the cells of body and coming back again to the lungs is called the transportation of gases.
 Transportation of oxygen takes place by haemoglobin present in blood.<br/>
Transportation of carbon dioxide from cells to lung takes place by haemoglobin only to the extent of 10 to 20%.<br/>

 </p>
 <p>Transportation of carbon dioxide takes place through circulation of blood:<br/>
<b>(a) By mixing with plasma :</b>Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid after mixing in plasma.
Transportation of 7% carbon dioxide takes place in this form.<br/>
(b). In the form of bicarbonates: 70% part of carbon dioxide in the form of bicarbonates is transported.
It mixes with potassium and sodium of blood and forms potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate.<br/>
<b>3. Internal respiration:</b> Inside the body, gaseous exchange takes place between blood and tissue fluid which is called internal respiration.
Note: The gaseous exchange in lungs is called external respiration.
<b>4. Cellular respiration:</b> Glucose is oxidised by oxygen reached into the cell.
This process is called cellular respiration.<br/>
Types of cellular respiration :<br/>

<b>There are two types of Respiration</b><br/>
(a) Anaerobic respiration: If the oxidation of food takes place in absence of oxygen.
During this only 2 ATP molecules are produced from one molecule of glucose. Final product
of anaerobic respiration in animal tissue like skeletal muscle cell is lactic acid.<br/>
In yeast and certain bacteria ethyl alcohol or ethanol is produced.

C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>    →   2C<sub>3</sub> H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>+ Energy (in animal)<br/>
                                                 (Lactic acid) <br/>
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>0<sub>6</sub>    →   2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH+2CO<sub>2</sub>+ Energy (in plant)<br/>

<b>(b) Aerobic respiration:</b> It takes place in the presence of oxygen.
The complete oxidation of glucose takes place. As a result CO2 and H2O is formed and energy is
 released in huge amount.<br/>

 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>+60<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + 2870 KJ energy. (38 ATP)

The complex process in cellular respiration is divided into two parts-<br/>

1. Glycolysis (cytoplasm)  2. Kreb&apos;s cycle (Mitochondria)<br/>
<b>1. Glycolysis:</b> Its study was first done by Embden Meyorh pathway. Therefore, it is also called EMP path<br/>
</p>
<ol>

 <li> Glycolysis is present in both types of respiration, Aerobic and Anaerobic. This process takes place in cytoplasm.</li>
 <li> As a result of decomposition of one glucose atom in glycolysis two atoms of pyruvic acid is formed.</li>
 <li> To start this process 2 atoms of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) takes part but at the end of the process 4 atoms ATP are obtained. </li>
 <li> Therefore, as a result of glycolysis 2 atom ATP are obtained i.e. 16000 calorie (2 × 8000) energy is obtained.</li>
 <li> There is no need of oxygen in glycolysis. Hence, this process is similar in both anaerobic and  aerobic respiration.</li>
 <li> In this, four molecules of hydrogen formed which is used in converting NAD to 2NADH<sub>2</sub></li>
 <li> The enzyme which take part in glycolysis during respiration are found in cell cytoplasm.</li>
</ol>


 <p><b>2. Kreb&apos;s Cycle:</b> It was described by Hens Krebs in 1937. This is also called Citric Acid Cycle or Tricarboxylic Cycle.</p>

 <ol>

 <li> This process is completed inside the Mitochondria in the presence of specific enzymes.</li>
 <li> Two atoms of each ADP and ATP are formed.</li>
 <li> In this cycle 4 pair of hydrogen atom are released.</li>
 <li> In complete cycle two molecule of pyruvic acid produce 12 molecule of carbondioxide.</li>
 <li> In our system maximum number of ATP molecule are formed during Kreb&apos;s Cycle.</li>
</ol>







 <p><b>Production of energy:</b> By the oxidation of pyruvic acid one atom of ATP, five atoms of NADH and
 one atom of NADH, are formed. From one atom of NADH three atoms of ATP and from one atom of NADH, two atoms
 of ATP are obtained. Hence, from one atom of pyruvic acid 1 + (3 × 5) 2+ (2 × 1) = 18 atoms of ATP are formed.
  From one atom of glucose two atoms of pyruvic acid are formed, by which 36 atoms of ATP are released.
  During the glycolysis, two atoms of ATP are obtained. Hence, during oxidation of one atom of glucose
  total 2 + 36 = 38 ATP atoms are obtained.
</p>


 <p><b>Respiratory substances:</b> Carbohydrate, fat and protein are the main respiratory substances.
 At first, oxidation of glucose takes place, then fat. After the consumption of carbohydrate and
 fat oxidation of protein start.<br/>
Note: Respiration is a Catabolic Process. It also reduces the weight of the body. <br/>

Respiration is controlled by medulla oblongeta.<br/>
Cyanide poisoning causes death in second due to breaking down the electron transport chain system.<br/>

<![CDATA[
<p>To maintain life organisms performs some basic function is called nutrition. Nutrition is one of
the basic function of life in which intake of food, digestion, absorption, assimilation and egestion
of undigested foods are included.
</p>
 <p><b>Nutrient :</b> Nutrient are the substance by which an organism get energy or it is used for biosynthesis of
 its body. For example carbohydrate and fat are the source of energy. Whereas proteins and minerals are
 the nutrient used for biosynthesis.<br/>
</p>
 <p><b>1. Carbohydrate:</b> Carbohydrates are organic compounds in which the ratio of Carbon,
 Hydrogen and Oxygen is 1: 2: 1. Carbohydrate in the form of sugar and starch are major intake in animals
 and human. 50 to 75% energy is obtained by oxidation of carbohydrate. Carbohydrate containing aldehyde
 group is called aldose and with ketone group is called ketose. Carbohydrates are derivatives of polyhydroxy
 alcohols.<br/>
 <b>Classification of carbohydrate:</b> Carbohydrates are classified into three major group.<br/>
<b>(a) Monosaccharides:</b> These are the simple sugar made up of single polyhydroxy or ketone unit.
Most abundant monosaccharides found in nature is glucose containing six carbon atom.
Triose, tetrose, pentoses, heptoses are the type of monosaccharides.

Glucose is a type of hexose sugar.<br/>

The sweetest sugar is fructose.<br/>

(b) Oligosaccharides: When 2 to 10 monosaccharides join together they form oligosaccharides.
They are usually crystalline in nature and sweet in test. Maltose, sucrose, lactose are disaccharides
made up of two monosaccharides.<br/>

© Polysaccharides: These are the compound of sugar which are formed due to joining large number of
monosaccharide. There are insoluble and tasteless. Some example of polysaccharides are starch, glycogen,
cellulose, chitin etc.

<b>Function of Carbohydrate</b><br/>

1. Carbohydrate works as fuel. During the process of respiration, glucose break into CO<sub>2</sub>,
and H<sub>2</sub>O with the release of energy. One gram of glucose gives 4.2 kilo calories energy.<br/>

2. Glucose is the source of immediate energy production in the cell.<br/>
3. Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleosides and nucleotides and contain pentose sugar.<br/>
4. Lactose of milk is formed from glucose and glactose.<br/>
5. Glucose is used for the formation of fat and amino acid.<br/>
6. Carbon skeleton of monosaccharides is used in the formation of fatty acid, chitin, cellulose etc.<br/>
<b>Source of Carbohydrate:</b> Wheat, rice, maize, sweet potato, potato and other plant and animals are the sources of carbohydrate.
<b>2. Protein:</b> Protein word was first used by J. Berzelius. This is a complex organic compound made up of
20 type of amino acids. Approximately 15% of the human body is made up of protein. Nitrogen is present
in protein in addition to C, H & O. <br/>
N<sub>2</sub> gas is essential for protein synthesis.<br/>
Twenty types of amino acid are necessary for human body, out of which 12 are synthesized by body itself
and remaining 8 are obtained by food are called essential amino acid.

<b>Types of proteins:</b><br/>
On the basis of chemical composition It is divided into three types.<br/>
(1) Simple Protein : It consists of only amino acid. Example-Albumins, Globulins, Histones etc.<br/>
(2) Conjugated Protein: Having some another chemical compounds in addition to amino acid.<br/>
Example-Chromo protein, Glyco protein etc.<br/>
(3) Derived Protein It is derived from the partial digestion of natural proteins or its hydrolysis.<br/>
Example-Peptone, Peptide, Proteinase etc.<br/>
Animal protein is called first class protein because it contain all the essential amino acid.<br/>

<b>Function of Protein:</b><br/>
1. It takes part in the formation of cells, protoplasm and tissues.<br/>
2. These are important for physical growth. Physical growth hampers by its deficiency.
Lack of proteins causes Kwashiorkor and Marasmus diseases in children.<br/>
3. In case of necessity these provide energy to the body. <br/>
4. Control the development of genetic characters.<br/>
5. Helpful in conduction also.<br/>
</p>
 <p><b>Kwashiorkor:</b> In this disease hands and legs of children get slimmed and the stomach comes out.<br/>

 <b>Marasmus :</b> In this disease muscles of children are loosened.<br/>
 3. Fats: Fat is an ester of glycerol and fatty acid.<br/>
In these carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are present in different quantities, but proportionally less oxygen than carbohydrate.<br/>
Normally fat remains as solid at 20°C temperature, but if it is in liquid form at this temperature, this is called oil
Fatty acids are of two types - Saturated and unsaturated. Unsaturated fatty acids are found in fish oil and vegetable oil. Only coconut oil and palm oil are the examples of saturated oil.<br/>
9.3 kilo calorie energy is liberated from 1 gram fat.<br/>
Normally an adult person should get 20-30% of energy from fat.<br/>
Main functions of fat:<br/>
1.It provides energy to the body.<br/>
2.It remains under the skin and prevents the loss of heat from the body. <br/>
3.It make the food material testy.<br/>
4.It protects different parts of the body from Injury.<br/>

Due to the lack of fat skin gets dried, weight of the body decreases and the development of the body checked.<br/>
Due to the excessiveness of fat the body gets fatty, heart disease takes place and blood pressure increases.<br/>
 <b>4. Vitamins: </b> Vitamin was invented by Sir F. G. Hopkins. The term vitamin was coined by Funk.<br/>
 Vitamins are organic compound required in minute quantities. No calorie is obtained from it,
 but it is very important in regulating chemical reactions in the metabolism of the body.<br/>
 On the basis of solubility, vitamins are of two types:<br/>
 (a) Vitamin soluble in water: Vitamin-B and Vitamin-C.<br/>
(b) Vitamin soluble in fat: Vitamin-A, Vitamin-D, Vitamin-E and Vitamin-K.<br/>

19. Arteriosclerosis: Due to deposition of cholesterol and calcium salt arteries became stiff and rigid. It loses the property of elasticity due to which wall of arteries may rapture.<br/>
20. Uremia: Presence of excess of urea in blood is called uremia. This is caused by malfunctioning of kidney.<br/>
21. Glycosuria: Presence of excess of glucose in urine is known as glycosuria. 22. Arthritis: It is disease in which inflammation of joints takes place.<br/>
23. Osteoporosis: It is a age dependent disorder of bone in which low bone mass and increased fragility takes place.<br/>
24. Hyperglycemia: It is disorder in which the concentration of glucose in the blood is high.<br/>
25. Hypoglycemia: It is a condition in which the concentration of glucose in the blood is very low.<br/>
26. Pneumonia: Acute inflamation of alveoli of lung.<br/>
27. Emphysema: It is the abnormal distension of alveoli which result in the loss of elasticity. Cigarette smoke and chronic bronchitis are two main causes. <br/>
28. Cancer: The uncontrolled growth of cell by its multiplication.<br/>
Their are four type of cancer.<br/>
Carcinoma: It is also known as skin cancer occur in epithelial tissue. <br/>
Sarconoma: Cancerous growth in connective tissue, bones, cartilage and muscles is called sarconoma.<br/>
29. Leukemia: Abnormal growth in the number of leucocytes, also known as blood cancer.<br/>
30. Lymphonoma: Cancerous growth occur in lymph node or spleen.<br/>
31. Chemotharapy: Chemotharapy is used in the treatment of cancer.<br/>
